Understanding the Goal**\n\n*   The question is asking to select the set of distances that, when inserted into the prompt, accurately describes the walking route to visit: Dior store -> Bloomingdale's -> UGG store in this order, with the starting position being facing Dior store.\n\n**2. Analyzing the Visual Data (Images)**\n\n*   The images provide a street-level view of the SoHo area in Manhattan. Key landmarks like storefronts, street signs (Greene St, Spring St, Broadway, Broome St, Mercer St) help understand spatial relationships.\n*   Note the locations of Dior (along Greene Street and close to Spring St). The location of Bloomingdale's being on Broadway and Spring St, the location of the UGG store on Mercer Street near Broome Street.\n\n**3. Building a Mental Map**\n\n*   Based on the pictures, imagine walking southwest on Greene Street to Spring Street\n*   Then turn left and go down the street for a bit. You'll see Bloomingdale's.\n*   Turn right and head southwest down Broadway\n*   Head to Broome Street, then turn right\n*   Turn right again on Mercer and walk down a bit to reach the UGG store.\n\n**4. Estimating and Comparing Distances**\n\n*   This is where the multiple-choice options come in. Need to decide which set of distances *relatively* makes sense for each leg of the journey.\n* Considering the blocks in Manhattan are about .1 mi, the option [B] seems to the most appropriate as the walk for Greene and spring is relatively shorter than the Broadway and Broome parts of the journey.\n\n**5.
