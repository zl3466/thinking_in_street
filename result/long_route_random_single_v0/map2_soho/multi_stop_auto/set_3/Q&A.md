    Turn [[[right]]] onto Greene St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
    The destination will be on the [[[right]]].

*   **Balenciaga to Converse Store:**

    To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Greene St toward Prince St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
    Turn [[[right]]] at the 2nd cross street onto W Houston St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.

Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head northwest on Spring St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Greene St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Greene St toward Prince St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Prince St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].

Based on the spatial information gathered from the images:

*   The MoMA Design Store is located on Spring Street between Broadway and Crosby Street.
*   Balenciaga is located on Greene Street between Spring and Prince Streets.

3.  **To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Greene St toward Prince St** This is moving along Greene St
4. **Turn right onto Prince St**: Balenciaga on Greene St to Prince St Corner (477 Broome St). M
5.  Turn right onto Broadway

To determine the distances:

1.  *Spring St to Greene St : Approximately 335.7 ft*
2. *Greene St Balenciaga location 1st to Prive: 0.1 mi*
3.  *Greene St to Prince St: 0.1 mi*
4.   *Prince St Broadway Intersection Distance: 346.7 ft*
5.   *Broadway, distance:0.1 miles.

So the answer is:
