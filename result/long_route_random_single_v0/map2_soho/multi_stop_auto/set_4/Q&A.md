Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head southwest on Mercer St toward Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 259 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 253 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Greene St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Spring St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto Broadway, then keep DRIVING for approximately 325 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Broadway toward Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto Grand St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 262 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Crosby St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn [?] at the 3rd cross street onto Prince St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 269 ft.
Turn [?] onto Broadway, then keep DRIVING for approximately 131 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right']      B. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left']
C. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left']      D. ['left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left']
Based on the images, here's the breakdown to determine the correct driving directions:

*   **UGG Store to Bloomingdale's:** Starting on Mercer Street facing southwest, there are several turns that can be made but considering that a 'left' turn is desired as the first step, these steps need to be taken to avoid any road law infringements and follow these instructions:

    *   Head southwest on Mercer St toward Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 259 ft.
    *   Turn **left** at the 1st cross street onto Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 253 ft.
    *   Turn **right** at the 1st cross street onto Greene St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
    *   Turn **left** at the 1st cross street onto Spring St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
    *   Turn **left** at the 2nd cross street onto Broadway, then keep DRIVING for approximately 325 ft.
    *   The destination (Bloomingdale's) will be on the **right**.

*   **Bloomingdale's to Converse:**
    *   Head southwest on Broadway toward Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
    *   Turn **left** onto Grand St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 262 ft.
    *   Turn **right** at the 1st cross street onto Crosby St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.
    *   Turn **left** at the 3rd cross street onto Prince St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 269 ft.
    *   Turn **left** onto Broadway, then keep DRIVING for approximately 131 ft.
    *   The destination will be on the **right**.

Based on the above instructions, the answers to the blanks would be as followed:
['left', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left']

Comparing these extracted directions, it matches B with the correction of the sixth direction word.

Therefore, the final answer is:
[[[B]]]

Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head southwest on Mercer St toward Broome St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Broome St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Broadway toward Spring St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 

A. ['259 ft', '262 ft', '213 ft', '0.1 mi']      B. ['200.8 ft', '0.0 mi', '185.8 ft', '221.0 ft']
C. ['186.0 ft', '0.1 mi', '246.8 ft', '266.2 ft']      D. ['166.1 ft', '0.2 mi', '168.7 ft', '245.1 ft']
Based on the images provided, the best option is:

[[[A]]]

Here's why and how the measurements are derived:

*   **UGG to Broome St:** The photos show Mercer Street. To go towards Bloomingdale's, which is on the other side of Broome Street, one need to head southwest on Mercer St toward Broome St. This distance is roughly 259 feet.

*   **Broome St Westward:** You then need to turn left onto Broome St so that the walking direction will be towards Broadway. This part of Broome St until Broadway is about 262 ft.

*   **Broadway Southward:** Turn left onto Broadway so that you can reach a Converse store that I located within the images. The required street traversal along Broadway in the south direction is about 213 ft.

*   **Broadway Northward:** To keep on the proposed order with the next destination being the Converse Store. Head northeast on Broadway towards Spring St about 0.1 mi.

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: UGG store, Bloomingdale's, Converse store within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ["Bloomingdale's, 504 Broadway, New York, NY 10012", 'Converse Flagship Store, 560 Broadway, New York, NY 10012', 'UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012']      B. ['UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012', 'Converse Flagship Store, 560 Broadway, New York, NY 10012', "Bloomingdale's, 504 Broadway, New York, NY 10012"]

Based on the street views, the optimal driving route, considering one-way streets, would be:

1.  Converse Flagship Store, 560 Broadway, New York, NY 10012
2.  Bloomingdale's, 504 Broadway, New York, NY 10012 (Slightly back track of less than one block)
