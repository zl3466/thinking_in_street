I want to traverse through the locations by foot: Converse store, UGG store, Dior store in this exact order, with the starting position being facing Converse store. Since you are walking by foot, you do not need to consider constraints such as a street being one-way drive.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[$letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head southwest on Broadway toward Spring St, then keep WALKING for approximately 394 ft.
Turn [?] onto Spring St, then keep WALKING for approximately 266 ft.
Turn [?] onto Mercer St, then keep WALKING for approximately 276 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Mercer St toward Spring St, then keep WALKING for approximately 276 ft.

Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head southwest on Broadway toward Spring St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Spring St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Mercer St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Mercer St toward Spring St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].

Based on the images, here's the analysis to determine the best traversal route:

*   **Start:** Facing the Converse store on Broadway. The traversal order: Converse -> UGG -> Dior

*   **Converse to UGG:** Head southwest on Broadway toward Spring St. Walk about 400 ft

*   **Broadway to Spring St:** Turn right onto Spring St. Walk for about 270 ft
    

*   **Spring St to Mercer St:** Turn left onto Mercer St. Walk for about 280 ft
    

*   **Mercer St to Spring St:** Head northeast on Mercer St toward Spring St. Walk for about 280 ft
    

*   **Spring St to Greene St:** Turn left onto Spring St. Walk for about 250 ft
    

*   **Greene to Dior St:** Turn right onto Greene St. Walk for about 300 ft

Therefore, the answer is:
