Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head northeast on Broadway toward Spring St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Spring St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northwest on Spring St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].
