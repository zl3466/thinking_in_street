[[[B]]]
Here's the breakdown of why the chosen answer is correct:

*   **Starting Point:** You're initially facing the Marriott Marquis on Broadway.

*   **First Destination: Chipotle on 48th St:** You need to head north on Broadway toward W 46th Street, then keep walking for approximately 465ft (heading north towards the next cross street). Then, turn right (east) onto W 48th st, you reach a chipotle after approximately 0.4 miles.

*   **Second Destination: Grace Building:** From the Chipotle on 48th St, head southeast to get to 6th Ave/Ave of the Americas and then a distance of 0.3 miles is traveled (Southeast to reach the Ave/ 6th Ave). Then you travel a distance of 454.8 ft on the Avenue of the Americas and 0.4 miles along the West 42nd Street.

So after mapping out the location by observing the street sign on the images, it is evident that the correct selection is B.

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: Marriott Marquis, a Chipotle on 48th St, the Grace Building within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['New York Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020', 'Grace Building, W. R. Grace Building, 1114 6th Ave, New York, NY 10110']      B. ['Grace Building, W. R. Grace Building, 1114 6th Ave, New York, NY 10110', 'New York Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020']
C. ['New York Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036', 'Grace Building, W. R.

Based on the street directions visible in the images and considering the one-way streets, the most time-efficient route would be:
1. **New York Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036**: Located on Broadway.
2. **Grace Building, W. R. Grace Building, 1114 6th Ave, New York, NY 10110**: Heading south on Broadway allows you to make a left onto 6th Avenue.
3. **Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020**: From 6th Avenue, going north enables a left turn onto 48th Street
