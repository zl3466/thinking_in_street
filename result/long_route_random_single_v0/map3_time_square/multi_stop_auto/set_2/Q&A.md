Here's the breakdown of the route and the distances, plus the answer:

**Understanding the Route**

*   **Start:** Facing the Grace Building on W 42nd Street and 6th Avenue/Ave of the Americas.
*   **First Destination:** Marriott Marquis is at W 45th St and Broadway
*   **Second Destination:** Chipotle on W 48th St in the Westbound direction.

**Reasoning for the Distances:**

1.  **Grace Building to 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the Americas intersection:** Assuming we are right at the entrance to Grace building, you'd travel approximately 364 feet, which is '0.1mi' down 42nd St.

2.  **Along 6th Ave/Ave of the Americas to 45th St:** You would then DRIVING south for 394.6 feet (0.1mi) on 6th ave.

3.  **Across W 45th St to next direction:** A left turn to the destination would have us DRIVING on W 45th St heading West toward 8th Ave, about (0.3 mi).

4.  **W 45th St toward 8th Ave:** Head west on W 45th St toward 8th Ave: DRIVING for 1/2 a block is about (0.05 miles) and 407 feet.

5.  **Along 8th Ave toward W 48th St:** Turn Right at the first block on 8th Ave Northbound (0 miles).

6.  **Along W 48th St:** Turn Right on the 3rd block onto W 48th St (about 0.4 miles).

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[[[C]]]
Head northwest on W 42nd St toward 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the Americas, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.1 mi]. 
Turn right onto 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the AmericasContinue to follow 6th Ave/Ave of the Americas, then keep DRIVING for approximately [394.6 ft]. 
Turn left at the 3rd cross street onto W 45th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.3 mi]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northwest on W 45th St toward 8th Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.5 mi]. 
Turn right at the 1st cross street onto 8th Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.0 mi]. 
Turn right at the 3rd cross street onto W 48th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.4 mi].

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: the Grace Building, Marriott Marquis, a Chipotle on 48th St within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['Grace Building, W. R. Grace Building, 1114 6th Ave, New York, NY 10110', 'New York Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020']      B. ['Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020', 'Grace Building, W. R. Grace Building, 1114 6th Ave, New York, NY 10110', 'New York Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036']
C. ['New York Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020', 'Grace Building, W. R. Grace Building, 1114 6th Ave, New York, NY 10110']      D. ['New York Marriott Marquis, 1535 Broadway, New York, NY 10036', 'Grace Building, W. R. Grace Building, 1114 6th Ave, New York, NY 10110', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020']
Based on the provided images, the optimal driving route would be to visit the New York Marriott Marquis, then Chipotle, and finally the Grace Building. Here's why:

*   **New York Marriott Marquis** It is on Broadway between 45th and 46th Streets. Driving north on Broadway is required.
*   **Chipotle Mexican Grill:** Located at 129 W 48th St, driving to the building from a major street such as 6th avenue and then going westward is required.
*   **Grace Building:** Located at 1114 6th Ave, being able to travel south on 6th avenue is required. Driving from the Marriott Marquis to 6th Avenue would require you to drive on 47th Street, from the Chipotle to 6th Avenue would require a drive on 48th street.

With these constraints in mind the optimal path would require you to visit the locations in this order to limit unnecessary backtracking. Thus, the answer is [[[C]]].
