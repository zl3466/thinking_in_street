Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head northeast on Avenue B toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto 1st Ave., then keep WALKING for approximately [?].

Head southwest on Avenue B toward E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right at the 1st cross street onto E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto 1st Ave., then keep DRIVING for approximately [?].

Turn right onto Avenue A, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 

A. ['150.8 ft', '0.2 mi', '549.1 ft', '391.3 ft', '56.6 ft', '546.6 ft']      B. ['46 ft', '0.3 mi', '0.2 mi', '436 ft', '0.1 mi', '400 ft']
C. ['732.7 ft', '0.2 mi', '458.5 ft', '544.0 ft', '579.2 ft', '328.3 ft']      D. ['302.7 ft', '0.1 mi', '52.6 ft', '598.3 ft', '52.6 ft', '291.7 ft']
Here's how we can figure this out:

1.  **Starting Point:** The prompt specifies facing Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union on Avenue B and beginning by heading southwest.

2.  **First destination:** The second destination is McDonald's on 1st Ave, so to get there from the credit union, you would have to turn on E 3rd St, go on 1st Ave to see the McDonald's.

3.  **Second destination:** The last destination from McDonald's is Blink Fitness, so heading northeast on 1st Ave, then turning on St Mark's Place onto Avenue A is needed to get to Blink Fitness.

Now let's look at the numbers and check if they seem reasonable:

*   *"Head southwest on Avenue B toward E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]*" - Driving southwest on Avenue B to E 3rd St is a short distance, around 300 feet.
*   *"Turn right at the 1st cross street onto E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]*" - Driving on E 3rd St onto 1st Ave a short distance, about 0.1 mi.
*   *"Turn right onto 1st Ave., then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]*" - To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on 1st Ave. toward E 7th St, McDonald's is not a long distance at all (like 50ft)
*   *"To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on 1st Ave. toward E 7th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]*" - Drivnig northeast on 1st Ave to get to the destination is a long distance, approximately 600ft, but then turning on the other streets gets you to the final destination.
*   *"Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto St Marks Pl, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]*" Driving towards St Marks street is not that far, about 50 ft.
*   *"Turn right onto Avenue A, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]*" The second cross street to get to the destination is Avenue A, which also is not too far, about 300 ft.

Considering both the directions and the distances, the answer is:

[[[D]]]
