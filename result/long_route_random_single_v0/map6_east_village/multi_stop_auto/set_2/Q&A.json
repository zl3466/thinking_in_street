Need to head Northeast.\n\n    *    From 1st to Key Food: 322 feet is about 0.1 miles\n\n    *   From Key Food to St Mark's Place: Need to head towards the east of the street to the next destination. The turns and mileage here don't quite work as described in the prompt as need to turn left to head to St Marks and then another left to head south.\n\n    * St Marks to Ave A: Can take a few turns to get to the appropriate street, but the distance is roughly 290 ft.\n\n    * Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately: Have walked the entire length of Ave A to its most northern point and is now on E 4th St.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is: [[[A]]]\nHead southwest on 1st Ave. toward E 6th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 322 ft. \nTurn left, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi. \nTurn right onto Avenue A, then keep WALKING for approximately 292 ft. \nTo continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.\n\n",

Determining Distances:**\n\n*   **1st Ave toward E 7th St:** From the images, the most optimal route is to make a right onto E 7th St, then making the next left and the next right\n    *   From 1st Avenue and E 6th, making a left onto E 7th St, the car must drive approximately 436ft\n\n*   **Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto St Marks Pl:** you would turn right onto Avenue A and then making another immediate right would make you turn into St. Marks Place.\n    *   Avenue A is 0.1 miles\n\n*   **Turn right onto Avenue A:** The next goal is to get to Blink Fitness on 2nd Avenue. the first road will be 1st Ave then 2nd Avenue, so the distance of travel here would be the length of the 1st avenue for about 0.2 miles\n\n*   **Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St:** This move would lead you towards the Key Food Grocery on Avenue A.
