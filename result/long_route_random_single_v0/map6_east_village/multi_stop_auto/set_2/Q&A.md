I want to traverse through the locations by foot: McDonald's on 1st Ave, Key Food, Blink Fitness in this exact order, with the starting position being facing McDonald's on 1st Ave. Since you are walking by foot, you do not need to consider constraints such as a street being one-way drive.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[$letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head southwest on 1st Ave. toward E 6th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 322 ft.
Turn [?], then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto Avenue A, then keep WALKING for approximately 292 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'right']      B. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'right']
C. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left']      D. ['left', 'left', 'right', 'left']
Based on the images and the requested route, the correct answer is:

[[[D]]]

Here's why:
* **McDonald's to Key Food:** To get from McDonald's to Key Food, you would head Southwest on 1st avenue, then turn left onto E 3rd street, which leads directly towards Key Food. 
*   Once on E 3rd street you'll need to turn left again, to make your way onto Ave A. On Ave A, Key Food would be on the right side.
*   **Key Food to Blink Fitness:** In order to continue on to Blink Fitness, you would head northeast on Ave A. Then Blink Fitness would be on the left, before reaching East 4th street.

Therefore, the complete instructions are:

Head southwest on 1st Ave. toward E 6th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 322 ft.
Turn [left], then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [left] onto Avenue A, then keep WALKING for approximately 292 ft.
The destination will be on the [right].
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
The destination will be on the [left].

Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head southwest on 1st Ave. toward E 6th St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Avenue A, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 

A. ['322 ft', '0.1 mi', '292 ft', '0.1 mi']      B. ['0.1 mi', '288.4 ft', '290.4 ft', '317.5 ft']
C. ['0.1 mi', '323.3 ft', '290.0 ft', '338.4 ft']      D. ['0.1 mi', '267.5 ft', '332.3 ft', '270.3 ft']
After reviewing the images, here's the rationale for my answer and the final choice:

*   **Understanding the Spatial Relationships:** The key is to map out the relative positions of the locations in the order you want to walk them:

    1.  **McDonald's on 1st Ave:** This is the starting point.
    2.  **Key Food:** From a general knowledge of the area and corroborated by the Street View images, Key Food is located on 1st Ave, further north.
    3.  **Blink Fitness:** Blink Fitness is located on Avenue A in the East Village, east from 1st Ave. So, first need to head East on St Marks Place to then walk South on Ave A.

*   **Analyzing the Traversal:**

    *   From McDonald's, heading **southwest** on 1st Ave isn't the immediate first step since it makes more sense to go north towards the key food market to head southwest. Need to head Northeast.

    *    From 1st to Key Food: 322 feet is about 0.1 miles

    *   From Key Food to St Mark's Place: Need to head towards the east of the street to the next destination. The turns and mileage here don't quite work as described in the prompt as need to turn left to head to St Marks and then another left to head south.

    * St Marks to Ave A: Can take a few turns to get to the appropriate street, but the distance is roughly 290 ft.

    * Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately: Have walked the entire length of Ave A to its most northern point and is now on E 4th St.

Therefore, the correct answer is: [[[A]]]
Head southwest on 1st Ave. toward E 6th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 322 ft. 
Turn left, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi. 
Turn right onto Avenue A, then keep WALKING for approximately 292 ft. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.

Head northeast on 1st Ave. toward E 7th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto St Marks Pl, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Avenue A, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?].

A. ['1357.5 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.2 mi', '82.5 ft']      B. ['438.2 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '119.8 ft']
C. ['436 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.2 mi', '0.1 mi']      D. ['470.4 ft', '0.0 mi', '0.1 mi', '408.7 ft']
Here's the breakdown of the optimal route and the answer:

**1. Analyzing the Route:**

* **Starting Point:** Facing McDonald's on 1st Ave.
* **Destination 1: McDonald's on 1st Ave to Key Food:** Based on the images, to go to Key Food, you first must head North.
* **Destination 2: Key Food to Blink Fitness:** to get to the Blink Fitness along 2nd avenue you have to take E 11th St, then Avenue A then 2nd Avenue.
* **Destination 3: Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St:** This takes you from the Blink location to the Key Food location

**2. Determining Distances:**

*   **1st Ave toward E 7th St:** From the images, the most optimal route is to make a right onto E 7th St, then making the next left and the next right
    *   From 1st Avenue and E 6th, making a left onto E 7th St, the car must drive approximately 436ft

*   **Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto St Marks Pl:** you would turn right onto Avenue A and then making another immediate right would make you turn into St. Marks Place.
    *   Avenue A is 0.1 miles

*   **Turn right onto Avenue A:** The next goal is to get to Blink Fitness on 2nd Avenue. the first road will be 1st Ave then 2nd Avenue, so the distance of travel here would be the length of the 1st avenue for about 0.2 miles

*   **Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St:** This move would lead you towards the Key Food Grocery on Avenue A. This means driving a distance of approximately 0.1 miles.

**Therefore, the answer is:**

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: McDonald's on 1st Ave, Key Food, Blink Fitness within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ["McDonald's, 102 1st Ave., New York, NY 10009", 'Blink Fitness East Village, 98 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009', 'Key Food Urban Marketplace, 52 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009']      B. ['Blink Fitness East Village, 98 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009', 'Key Food Urban Marketplace, 52 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009', "McDonald's, 102 1st Ave., New York, NY 10009"]
C. ["McDonald's, 102 1st Ave., New York, NY 10009", 'Blink Fitness East Village, 98 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009', 'Key Food Urban Marketplace, 52 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009']      D. ["McDonald's, 102 1st Ave., New York, NY 10009", 'Key Food Urban Marketplace, 52 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009', 'Blink Fitness East Village, 98 Avenue A, New York, NY 10009']
Based on the images and considering the one-way street configurations:
*   1st Avenue is generally northbound.
*   Avenue A is generally southbound.

Therefore, given the locations:
*   McDonald's is on 1st Ave (northbound).
*   Blink Fitness and Key Food are on Avenue A (southbound).

The most time-efficient order to visit all locations starting point in where all the photos are taken:
1. Drive north on 1st Ave, starting with McDonald's.
2. Then cross over to Avenue A to head south to Blink Fitness
3. Continue south to Key Food.

So the answer must be:

[[[A]]]
