Blink Fitness was located on Avenue A between 7th and 8th Street, so heading toward 7th Street, to then turn onto E 9th Street you would need to turn **left**. Then you keep walking east for approximately 0.3mi and the destination (Citizens on 2nd Av) is located on the **right**.\nTherefore the first two options to be filled in is 'left' and 'right'.\n\n3.  **From Citizens to Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union:** The instructions say to head southeast on E 9th St toward 2nd Ave, and then turn [?] and continue to the destination. From the images, if you are facing southeast (heading back toward 2nd Avenue), to then cross and turn onto 2nd Avenue in the correct direction, you would need to make a slight **right** turn on the side of the street after the pedestrian crossing.\n\n4. From here, the instructions say to Slight [?], then keep WALKING for approximately 13 ft. In order to walk on the same side, toward the East River, you would have to make a slight **right**.\nTherefore the fourth option to be filled in is 'right'.\n5. After you make a slight right to stay on the side you are walking on, to go toward the next destination you have to: Turn [?], then keep WALKING for approximately 358 ft.. To be able to see the store and walk into it at 34 Avenue B to walk into, it requires you to make a **left** turn.\n6. Once you leave the establishment, you are faced with the instruction to, Turn [?] toward Avenue B, then keep WALKING for approximately 344 ft, turn [?] onto Avenue B, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi, and the destination will be on the [?].\n\nFirst, there is a turn **right** that puts you on East 4th St. Then, there is another turn, this time **left** onto Avenue B.\n\nFollowing all the turns and directions, the last destination would be located on the **right**.\n\nTherefore the full sequence is: ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']\n\nTherefore the answer is [[[$D]]]",

The prompt states the starting direction is to the northeast.\n2.  **First Destination: Citizens**\n*   **E 9th St turn from Avenue A:** East 9th Street intersects with Avenue A, and to get to Citizens you would need to turn *left* to head East on E 9th St.\n*   **Position of Citizens:** The prompt states the destination will be on the *left*\n3.  **Next Destination: Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union**\n*   **3rd Av turn from E 9th St**: 3rd Avenue intersects with E 9th Street. And after heading northwest towards 3rd Avenue, we see that the next turn requires to turn *left*.\n*   **E 6th St turn from 3rd Avenue**: E 6th Street intersects with 3rd Avenue. To reach our location, after heading north, we see that we must turn *left*.\n*   **Avenue B turn from E 6th Street**: Avenue B intersects with E 6th Street. To find our location, after heading East on E 6th Street, we see that we must turn *right*.\n*   **Position of Lower East Side Federal Credit Union**: The end destination will be on the *left*.\n\nSo, the route directions are:\n\nHead northeast on Avenue A toward E 7th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.\nTurn **left** onto E 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.\nThe destination will be on the **left**.\nTo continue to the next destination, Head northwest on E 9th St toward Stuyvesant St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.\nTurn **left** onto 3rd Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.\nTurn **left** onto E 6th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.6 mi.\nTurn **right** onto Avenue B, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.\nThe destination will be on the **left**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is [[[C]]]\n",
