Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] onto E 9th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on E 9th St toward 2nd Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn [?] onto Avenue A, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'left', 'left', 'left']      B. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'right']
C. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'right']      D. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right']
Here's the breakdown of how to solve this problem using the images and determine the correct directions:

*   **1. Analyze the Start (Key Food) and First Destination (Citizens on 2nd Av):**

    *   Starting position is facing Key Food.
    *   From Key Food, you walk towards Avenue A. This implies taking the road facing Avenue A and heading towards North East.
    *   Then, you need to find your way towards Citizens on 2nd Av.
    *   This entails turning to the LEFT at East 9th Street, then continue forward to finally arrive at the location of Citizens on 2nd Av on the RIGHT.

*   **2. Analyze Second Destination(Citizens on 2nd Av) and Third Destination (Blink Fitness):**

    *   After arriving at Citizens on 2nd Av, the next goal is Blink Fitness. To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on E 9th St toward 2nd Ave.
    *   Continue WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi. Turn RIGHT onto Avenue A. and WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi. to see Blink Fitness on your RIGHT.

*Putting it all together*
First Blank: "Left"
Second Blank: "Right"
Third Blank: "Right"
Fourth Blank: "Right"

Therefore, the answer is [[[B]]]

Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] onto E 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head northwest on E 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 420 ft.
Sharp [?] onto Stuyvesant St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 364 ft.
Turn [?] onto E 10th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn [?] at the 3rd cross street onto Avenue A, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right']      B. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right']
C. ['right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right']      D. ['left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left']
Based on the images provided and the constraint of driving (obeying one-way streets), the correct traversal route is as follows:

1. **Key Food** (start, facing northeast).
2. **Citizens on 2nd Avenue**: Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi. Turn right onto E 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi. The destination will be on the right. 
3. **Blink Fitness:** To continue to the next destination, Head northwest on E 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 420 ft. Sharp left onto Stuyvesant St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 364 ft. Turn right at the 3rd cross street onto Avenue A, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi. The destination will be on the right.

So the answer is [[[A]]]

Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head northeast on Avenue A toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto E 9th St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on E 9th St toward 2nd Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Avenue A, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 

A. ['0.4 mi', '0.4 mi', '0.2 mi', '0.2 mi']      B. ['0.0 mi', '0.3 mi', '0.4 mi', '0.3 mi']
C. ['0.2 mi', '0.3 mi', '0.3 mi', '0.1 mi']      D. ['0.4 mi', '0.0 mi', '0.2 mi', '0.2 mi']
Here's the breakdown and the answer:

*   **Understanding the Desired Route:**
    The prompt specifies the destinations in this order: Key Food -> Citizens on 2nd Ave -> Blink Fitness.
    From the starting location (facing Key Food), you first must head towards Citizen, before Blink.

*   **Avenue A toward E 4th St:** You must go around to be facing North East (NE) on Avenue A. Key food is very close to the starting point. Thus, [0.0mi] for the first distance.

*   **E 9th St:** After walking on Avenue A, you have to turn left to E 9th st, after the E 9th St, walk towards 2nd Ave towards Citizen, distance is approximately [0.3 mi].

*   **E 9th St toward 2nd Ave:** It makes sense to walk back south for that distance. Given that Blink is near the intersection of 2nd Av and E 9th St, the approximate distance must be [0.4 mi]

*   **Avenue A, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].** The best option is 0.3 mi: This is the distance to get to 430 E 14th St, New York, NY 10009, which is very close to the ending destination.

Given these calculations, the correct answer is:

Here's the breakdown to determine the answer:

1.  **Starting Point and Orientation:** The prompt states that the starting point is Key Food facing Key Food, which the direction of facing would be towards northeast.

2.  **Traversal Route:**
    *   Head northeast on Avenue A: From the Key Food, the best way to traverse on Avenue A is heading northeast on Avenue A.
    *   Turn left onto E 9th St: East 9th St from Avenue A is going northeast.
    *   Head northwest on E 9th St: Stuyvesant St is a right turn heading northwest.
    *   Sharp right onto Stuyvesant St: Then after sharp right, head southeast along the street.
    *   Turn right onto E 10th St: The best path on Stuyvesant st is to turn right onto East 10th St.
    *   Avenue A: Lastly, turning onto Avenue A heads towards the Blink Fitness, which matches the instructions.

3.  **Distance Estimation**: The distances on the traversed routes needs to be approximated.

*   Key Food -> E 4th St: Approximately 0.2 mi
*   Turn left onto E 9th St for [?]: From Google maps, the distance is about 462 ft.
*   Head northwest on E 9th St for [?]: Stuyvesant St is 0.1 mi away.
*   Sharp right onto Stuyvesant St for [?]: E 10th st is 0.2 mi away.
*   Turn right onto E 10th St for [?]: The 3rd cross street is Ave A at approximately 443ft.
*   Turn right onto Avenue A and keep driving [?] - 0.2mi until reaching Blink Fitness.

Given the analysis, the answer is [[[D]]]
