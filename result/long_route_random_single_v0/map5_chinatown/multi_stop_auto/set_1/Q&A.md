Here's the breakdown of the route and the reasoning behind the correct answer:

**Starting Point: Facing Pace School on Hester St.**
**Objective 1: Pace School -> Citibank**

Head east on Hester St toward Eldridge St: This starts you off in the right direction.
Turn [[C]] right at the 1st cross street onto Eldridge St:  This makes you head south
Turn right onto Grand St:  Heading west
Turn right onto Chrystie St:  Heading North
Turn left onto Hester St:  Heading West
Turn left at the 3rd cross street onto Mott St: North
Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Canal St:  This gets you to the Citibank

**Objective 2: Citibank -> New York Jewelers Exchange**

Head southeast on Canal St toward Elizabeth St: Now in right direction
Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Elizabeth St: The most East-Bound Street
Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto Grand St: This makes you go East
Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto Chrystie St: Head North
Turn left onto Hester St: Now heading west
Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Bowery: Heading south

**Explanation**

The detailed driving directions with "right" and "left" in them correctly describes the actions to take to travel through the landmarks. I have analyzed each direction with spatial information that I have been trained on to identify the choice that makes the most sense.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
[[[C]]]

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: A school called Pace, Citi Bank, New York Jewelers Exchange within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'New York Jewelers Exchange, 70-72, 74 Bowery, New York, NY 10013']      B. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'New York Jewelers Exchange, 70-72, 74 Bowery, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']
C. ['Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'New York Jewelers Exchange, 70-72, 74 Bowery, New York, NY 10013', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013']      D. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'New York Jewelers Exchange, 70-72, 74 Bowery, New York, NY 10013']
Based on the street views and one-way street constraints apparent in the images, I would recommend the following: 
Starting from 'Pace High School' proceed to 'New York Jewelers Exchange', then to 'Citi' on Canal street.
So the answer should be: [[[C]]]
