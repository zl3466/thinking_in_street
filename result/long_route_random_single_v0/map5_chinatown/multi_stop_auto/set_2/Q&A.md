The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: Chase Bank on Grand St, Citi Bank, A school called Pace within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'Chase Bank, 231 Grand St, New York, NY 10013', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013']      B. ['Chase Bank, 231 Grand St, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013']
C. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'Chase Bank, 231 Grand St, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']      D. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'Chase Bank, 231 Grand St, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']
[[[C]]]
Analyzing the images, and taking into account road direction constraints (One Way), option C is the most time efficient for driving among these locations.
Citi, Chase, Pace Highschool order would allow for smooth progress along Canal st and then Hester St. Other options would likely require back tracking and longer times.
