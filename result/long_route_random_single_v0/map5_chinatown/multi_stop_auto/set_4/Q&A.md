Based on the images provided, here is the analysis and answer:

The prompt asks for the walking direction from Grand St Chase bank (Point A) -> the school called Pace (Point B) -> Anj Convenience (Point C)

The images provided start near Grand St Chase bank going southeast on Grand St. Then eventually goes to Pace building at the junction of Hester St, then turning back to head toward Eldridge St (Anj is on this area). Based on this information, the directions are:
1. Head southeast on Grand St toward Bowery: It seems that in order to head toward Bowery, the vehicle travels for a LONG distance.
2. Turn right toward Hester St: Turn right from Grand St toward Hester St has a reasonable amount of walking/driving.
3. Turn left toward Hester St: This step does not make much sense, because you only need to head toward one direction only after turning to Hester. Also the images shows vehicle driving a long distance which means this step could not be short.
4. Turn left onto Hester St: Once again, another left onto Hester does not seem right since it is only one route in which to traverse along Hester.
5. Head east on Hester St toward Eldridge St: Head east onto Hester Street toward Eldridge street with a walking distance.

The most reasonable response is then D:
Head southeast on Grand St toward Bowery, then keep WALKING for approximately [50.1 ft]. 
Turn right toward Hester St, then keep WALKING for approximately [845.5 ft]. 
Turn left toward Hester St, then keep WALKING for approximately [75.6 ft]. 
Turn left onto Hester St, then keep WALKING for approximately [495.9 ft]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head east on Hester St toward Eldridge St, then keep WALKING for approximately [377.4 ft].
