Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head northeast on Bedford Ave toward N 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 482 ft.
Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto N 12th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto Wythe Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn [?] onto N 6th StParts of this road may be closed at certain times or days, then keep DRIVING for approximately 492 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on N 6th St toward Kent Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 36 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Kent Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn [?] onto N 13th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 459 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Wythe Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 413 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right']      B. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right']
C. ['left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left']      D. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left']
Here's the breakdown to determine the correct route:

1. **Starting at Mugs Ale House on Bedford Ave**: Facing Northeast is the correct direction of travel.

2. **First destination, 6th St. CVS**:
   - "Head northeast on Bedford Ave toward N 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 482 ft."
   - "Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto N 12th St"  From the Images, Turning "right" takes you on to N 12th St.
   - "Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto Wythe Ave"  From the images, Turning "right" takes you to Wythe Ave.
   - "Turn [?] onto N 6th StParts of this road may be closed at certain times or days, then keep DRIVING for approximately 492 ft."  From the images, Turning "right" takes you on N 6th street.
   - "The destination will be on the [?]". From the images, the CVS is on the "left".

3. **Second destination, Brooklyn Bowl from CVS on 6th street. Brooklyn Bowl is on N 13th street**
    - "Head southeast on N 6th St toward Kent Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 36 ft."
    - "Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Kent Ave"  From the images Turning "left" take you on to Kent Ave.
   - "Turn [?] onto N 13th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 459 ft." From the images Turning "left" take you on N 13th street.
    - "Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Wythe Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 413 ft" From the images Turning "right" take you on Wythe Ave.
    - "The destination will be on the [?]." Brooklyn Bowl is on the "right."

Based on the path and logic provided above, the values that should be entered are:
['right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right']

The letter corresponding to this combination of values is A and therefore the answer is:
[[[A]]]

Here's the breakdown of the correct route and why the answer is the one provided:

*   **Understanding the Spatial Relationships** The series of images provides a virtual tour of the streets in Williamsburg. To solve this, we need to understand the general layout and direction of the streets involved (Bedford, N 11th, N 12th, Wythe, N 6th, Kent Ave, and N 13th), and determine which way we would have to turn to get from Mugs Ale House to the CVS, then to the Brooklyn Bowl.

*   **Starting at Mugs Ale House:** Assuming you're facing the front entrance of Mugs Ale House on Bedford Avenue, you're going to head northeast.

*   **Reconstructing the Traversal**

    *   Head northeast on Bedford Avenue: [[[]D]]]
        *   Bedford Avenue is a 2 way traffic road, and Mugs Ale is on the west side. Therefore, you need to head northeast on Bedford Ave. 0.2 mi
    *   Turn left at the 2nd cross street onto N 12th St: 78.5 ft
        * N 12th Street is the second cross street when driving northeast.
    *   Turn left at the 2nd cross street onto Wythe Ave: 0.3 mi
        * To make this turn, head East to get to the junction of Wythe Ave and make a left on the one way south bound street, Wythe.
    *   Turn right onto N 6th StParts of this road may be closed at certain times or days: 0.3 mi
    * To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on N 6th St toward Kent Ave: 0.3 mi
        * Now driving on N 6th St from west to East, head towards Kent Avenue on the south east direction.
    *   Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Kent Ave: 269.6 ft
        * At N 6th street's only available cross street, turn left on Kent Ave from East to North
    *   Turn right onto N 13th St: 0.1 mi
        * After traversing up north of Kent Ave, the first avenue with a clear right would be N 13th street.
    *   Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Wythe Ave: 0.3 mi
        * Then a simple right turn would be onto the North bound Wythe avenue where The Brooklyn Bowl is located.

The answer is [[[D]]]

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: Mugs Ale House, a CVS store on 6th St, Brooklyn Bowl within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'CVS, 27 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'Mugs Ale House, 125 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211']      B. ['Mugs Ale House, 125 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211', 'CVS, 27 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249']
C. ['Mugs Ale House, 125 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211', 'Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'CVS, 27 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249']      D. ['Mugs Ale House, 125 Bedford Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211', 'Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'CVS, 27 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249']
Based on the street views, the optimal route would be:

Mugs Ale House (125 Bedford Ave) -> CVS (27 N 6th St) -> Brooklyn Bowl (61 Wythe Ave).

Here's why:

*   Bedford Avenue is known to be one-way (southbound) in that area. This limits how you approach and exit Mugs Ale House.
*   North 6th street in Brooklyn runs west between Bedford and Wythe. Since you're heading to CVS (27 N 6th Street), going there after Mugs is the easiest transition.
*   Wythe Avenue (Brooklyn Bowl's location) is one-way northbound for most of its stretch. Making it the last stop allows for an easy northward exit towards the next destination.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
[[[B]]]
