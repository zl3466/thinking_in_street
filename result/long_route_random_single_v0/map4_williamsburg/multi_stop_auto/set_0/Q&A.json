This limits how you approach and exit Mugs Ale House.\n*   North 6th street in Brooklyn runs west between Bedford and Wythe. Since you're heading to CVS (27 N 6th Street), going there after Mugs is the easiest transition.\n*   Wythe Avenue (Brooklyn Bowl's location) is one-way northbound for most of its stretch.
