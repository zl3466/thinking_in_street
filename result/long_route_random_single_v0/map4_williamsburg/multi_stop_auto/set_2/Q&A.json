Mugs Ale House was already in view so it will be marked as the starting location.\n\n2.  **Mugs Ale House to The Williamsburg Hotel:**\n    *   The goal here is to end up at The Williamsburg Hotel. Head northeast on Bedford Ave toward N 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 482 ft. You are currently in the correct direction towards the hotel.\n    *   Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto N 12th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi. (Wythe Ave is a one-way going away from you so this is not the hotel.)\n    *   Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto Wythe Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 436 ft. and you will spot The Williamsburg Hotel at the right.\n\n3.  **The Williamsburg Hotel to the Russian Round-Top Cathedral:**\n    *   Head southwest on Wythe Ave toward N 10th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 344 ft. You are currently driving away from the Russian church.\n    *   Turn left at the 2nd cross street onto N 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi. (N 10th St only has one street to the right.)\n    *   Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Berry St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.

(If you went left you would drive into the water).\n    * Sharp right onto Union Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 407 ft.
