Here's the breakdown of the best route and why the selected answer is correct:

**Route Analysis (IHOP -> Marriott -> Brooklyn Cancer Center):**

1.  **Starting at IHOP:**

    *   Head northwest on Livingston St toward Elm Pl (aligns correctly with the current direction and street).
2.  **Reaching Boerum Pl:**

    *   You'll turn right onto Boerum Pl (this is necessary because Livingston Street intersects with Boerum Pl on the right).
3.  **To Adams St/Brooklyn Bridge Blvd:**
    *   A slight right onto Adams St/Brooklyn Bridge Blvd is correct for making the turn.
4.  **Left Turn toward Marriott**
    * To turn into the entrance of the Marriott hotel, a right turn must be executed, followed by a left turn to reach the destination.
5.  **Leaving Marriott:**

    *   Head north toward Adams St/Brooklyn Bridge Blvd.
    *   Turn right toward Adams St/Brooklyn Bridge Blvd
6.  **Moving to Brooklyn Cancer Center:**
    * From the intersection at Boerum Pl make a left onto Tillary Street.
    * Make a right onto Navy Street
    * Continue onto Ashland Pl.
    * Finally make a right onto Willoughby St, followed by a left onto Fleet Place to reach the destination.

Here's the breakdown to determine the correct option:

*   **Starting Point and First Leg: IHOP to Marriott.**

    *   The images confirm that IHOP is located on the corner of Livingston Street and Hoyt Street. With the camera (and presumed driver) facing the IHOP, the initial direction is northwest on Livingston street heading toward Elm Pl.
    *   The route from Livingston Street to Boerum Place, a slight right to Adams Street, and then another right to a small un-named road looks reasonable.

*   **Second Leg: Marriott to Brooklyn Cancer Center.**

    *   Turn left towards Adams Street from the un-named road. Turn right onto Adams St/Brooklyn Bridge Blvd. Turn right onto Tillary St. Turn right onto Navy St. Continue onto Ashland Pl, Turn right onto Willoughby St, Turn right onto Fleet Pl is the only viable sequence of instructions, as other variations will cause you to drive further away from the intended destination, or drive on the incorrect side of the road.

Based on this analysis, the only options that support the driving direction needed for this type of navigation are:

*    A: ['0.3 mi', '0.1 mi', '364 ft', '72 ft', '85 ft', '30 ft', '0.2 mi', '0.4 mi', '0.2 mi', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi']
    *   D: ['116.8 ft', '396.7 ft', '368.0 ft', '0.3 mi', '106.7 ft', '0.3 mi', '654.1 ft', '506.4 ft', '381.7 ft', '0.5 mi', '0.3 mi', '0.4 mi']

However, considering the distance between the given locations as seen on Google Map, 'A' seems to be the most fitting values.

Therefore, the answer is:

[[[A]]]

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: IHOP, Marriott, Brooklyn Cancer Center within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, Adams Street, Brooklyn, NY', 'The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      B. ['New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, Adams Street, Brooklyn, NY', 'The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
C. ['New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, Adams Street, Brooklyn, NY', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      D. ['The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, Adams Street, Brooklyn, NY']
Based on the street view images, considering the one-way street constraints and overall road layout:

The most optimal order appears to be:

Marriott - then, IHOP - and lastly, Brooklyn Cancer Center.
A close second could be: Marriott -then, Brooklyn Cancer Center- and lastly IHOP.
