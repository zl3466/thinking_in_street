The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: AT&T, Marriott, IHOP within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, Adams Street, Brooklyn, NY']      B. ['IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, Adams Street, Brooklyn, NY']
C. ['New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, Adams Street, Brooklyn, NY', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      D. ['IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, Adams Street, Brooklyn, NY', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
Based on the street views and considering typical one-way street patterns in this area of Brooklyn:

*   **New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge (Adams Street):** Generally on the eastern side of the area considered in the street view.
*   **AT&T Store (476-478 Fulton St):** Located westward toward the Fulton Mall.
*   **IHOP (253 Livingston St):** Located westward past AT&T.

Given the street layout, Adams Street would make sense to go there first. Going westward along Fulton, you'll hit the AT&T. Going farther west would land you close to IHOP.

Therefore, the optimal route would be: New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge -> AT&T Store -> IHOP.
