Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[$letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head northwest on Livingston St toward Elm Pl, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto Hoyt St, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.
Turn [?] onto Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] onto Boerum Pl, then keep WALKING for approximately 413 ft.
Continue onto Adams St/Brooklyn Bridge Blvd, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Slight [?], then keep WALKING for approximately 72 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right']      B. ['left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right']
C. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left']      D. ['right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right']
Based on the images provided, here is my analysis to determine the correct travel route to walk by foot from Goodwill, to Kung Fu Tea, and to Marriott in Brooklyn, while facing Goodwill at the beginning of the journey:

*   **First Destination: Goodwill to Kung Fu Tea:**

    *   Start facing Goodwill on Livingston St.
    *   Proceed straight and head northwest on Livingston St.
    *   Make a **left** onto Hoyt St. Kung Fu Tea will be on the **right** side of the street.

*   **Second Destination: Kung Fu Tea to Marriott:**

    *   Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St.
    *   Make a **right** onto Livingston St.
    *   Make a **left** onto Boerum Pl.
    *   Continue onto Adams St/Brooklyn Bridge Blvd, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
    *   Slightly to the **right**
    *   The destination will be on the **right**.

So the sequence of directions is: left, right, left, right, right, right

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[[[B]]]

Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head northwest on Livingston St toward Elm Pl, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Hoyt St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].

A. ['0.3 mi', '165.8 ft', '0.2 mi', '0.1 mi', '49.4 ft', '426.3 ft', '666.7 ft']      B. ['0.1 mi', '467.5 ft', '0.0 mi', '0.3 mi', '293.2 ft', '297.4 ft', '418.9 ft']

Here's the breakdown of how to determine the answer:

1. **Analyze the starting location and the order of destinations**:
   - The prompt says you're starting facing Goodwill (at corner of Livingston St and Hoyt st.
   - The destination order is: Goodwill -> Kung Fu Tea -> Marriott.

2. **Trace the route through the images to the destination:**
   - Step 1 to Kong Fu Tea: Northwest on Livingston St to 48 Hoyt St
   - Step 2 to Marriott: Northeast on Hoyt St to Adams St
   - Step 3 to Marriott: Right to Boerum Pl to Brooklyn Bridge Blvd, the hotel near 333 Adams St

3. **Extract the distances**:
   - Start at Livingston St and Hoyt St: Head northwest on Livingston St to Elm Pl: 0.1 mi
   - Turn left onto Hoyt St: 48 Hoyt Street is  497.0 ft.
   - Head northeast on Hoyt St: Approximately 0.2 mi
   - Turn left onto Livingston St: About 0.1mi
   - Turn right onto Boerum Pl, then keep WALKING for approximately 545.7 ft
   - Continue onto Adams St/Brooklyn Bridge Blvd, then keep WALKING for approximately 65.0 ft
   - Slight right, then keep WALKING for approximately 314.2 ft

Therefore, based on my analysis, the correct sequence of units in different units is:

D. ['0.1 mi', '497.0 ft', '0.2 mi', '0.1 mi', '545.7 ft', '65.0 ft', '314.2 ft']

Here's the breakdown to determine the correct traversal and fill in the distances:

**1. Understanding the Locations and Desired Path:**

*   **GoodWill:** This is our starting point, and we're facing away from it initially (facing Northwest on Livingston St)
*   **Kong Fu Tea:** Located northeast of GoodWill.
*   **Marriott:** Farthest location and to the Southeast from Kong Fu Tea

**2. Analyzing Street Network (based on the images):**

*   Livingston St, Hoyt st, and Adams st - The way to connect from Good Will to Kong Fu Tea to Marriot.

**3. Determining the Correct Travel Path & Distances (Based on Images and Assumptions from street layout)**
GoodWill, Kong Fu Tea, Marriott

*   Head northwest on Livingston St toward Elm Pl,
    *   0.1 mi, as going toward Elm Pl takes the car away from it and to hoyt st
*   Turn left onto Hoyt St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **79 ft**. 
    *   79 ft, as 102 Hoyt st, New York, NY 11201 is not too far down after the turn
*   To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Hoyt St toward Schermerhorn St, then keep DRIVING for approximately  **0.1 mi**.
    *  0.1 miles, as that is distance to make the right hand turn onto Atlantic Ave
*   Turn right onto Atlantic Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately **0.2 mi**. 
    *   0.2 miles is the closest amount to where the turn onto the Brooklyn Bridge is
*   Turn right onto Boerum Pl, then keep DRIVING for approximately **0.3 mi**.
    *   0.3 mile, is enough to change and begin taking Adams St to the Marriot
*   Slight right onto Adams St/Brooklyn Bridge Blvd, then keep DRIVING for approximately **364 ft**.
    *   364 is how far before you need to turn in front of Brooklyn Borough Hall

*   Turn right, then keep DRIVING for approximately **72 ft**.
    *   72 is the approximate distance down to a stop at Marriot
