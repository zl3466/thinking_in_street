Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[$letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head south on Fleet Pl toward Fair St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Take the crosswalk, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] toward Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately 118 ft.
Turn [?] onto Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately 49 ft.
Turn [?] onto Fulton St, then keep WALKING for approximately 486 ft.
Turn [?] onto Hoyt St, then keep WALKING for approximately 459 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.
Turn [?] onto Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right']      B. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left']
C. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left']      D. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']
Based on the spatial information extracted from the images and the desired traversal route, the correct answer is: [[[$C]]] 
Here's why:

*   **Starting at Brooklyn Cancer Center (BCC):** You're facing South.
    *   "Head south on Fleet Pl toward Fair St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi"
    *   "Take the crosswalk, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi" - The crosswalk will be just a block or two from B.C.C.
    *   "Turn *left* toward Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately 118 ft.": You need to turn *left* to face that direction to go to the second location.
    *   "Turn *right* onto Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately 49 ft.": You need to turn right from Albee Square W/Gold St.
    *   "Turn *right* onto Fulton St, then keep WALKING for approximately 486 ft.": You need to turn right from Fulton St to get into that second position
    *   "Turn *left* onto Hoyt St, then keep WALKING for approximately 459 ft.": You need to turn *left* to face that direction to go to the second location.

The first destination (Kung Fu Tea) will be on the left from where you face.

*   **From Kung Fu Tea**: You are headed Northeast.
    *   "Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft"
    *   "Turn *left* onto Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.": You need to turn *left* to face that direction to go to the second location.

The final destination (Ihop) will be on the left from where you face.

Therefore, the correct sequence of directions is *left, right, right, left, left, left, left*, corresponding to option C.

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: Brooklyn Cancer Center, Kong Fu Tea, IHOP within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      B. ['The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
C. ['IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      D. ['The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
Based on the street network visible in the images, here's the optimal order for visiting those locations, keeping in mind the likely one-way street configurations:

* **1. The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201:** As the beginning of this path, its location seems convenient to access without causing unnecessary backtracking.
* **2. IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201:** Since IHOP is located a little bit down the street from the cancer center it makes a logical and very short path to the second destination.
* **3. Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201:** Given that some of the streets in this area appear to be one-way, proceeding towards Hoyt Street after IHOP avoids the possibility of needing to circle back later.
Therefore, the optimal, time-efficient driving order is listed in this order The Brooklyn Cancer Center, then IHOP, and then Kung Fu Tea.
