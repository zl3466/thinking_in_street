Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head north on Fleet Pl toward Myrtle Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 49 ft.
Turn [?] onto Myrtle Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Myrtle Ave turns left and becomes Abolitionist Pl/Duffield St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto Willoughby St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 259 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Bridge St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto Hoyt St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 459 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Hoyt St toward Schermerhorn St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 171 ft.
Turn [?] onto Schermerhorn St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Bond St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 49 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left']      B. ['left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left']
C. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right']      D. ['right', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right']
Here's the analysis to determine the correct sequence of turns:

*   **Starting Position: Facing Brooklyn Cancer Center:** This establishes the initial direction.

*   **Brooklyn Cancer Center to Kong Fu Tea:** We need to go in the opposite direction first:
    *   Head north on Fleet Pl toward Myrtle Ave: DRIVING straight.
    *   Turn [RIGHT] onto Myrtle Ave: DRIVING right.
    *   Myrtle Ave turns left and becomes Abolitionist Pl/Duffield St:  DRIVING straight.
    *   Turn [LEFT] onto Willoughby St: DRIVING left.
    *   Turn [LEFT] at the 1st cross street onto Bridge St: DRIVING left.
    *   Turn [RIGHT] onto Hoyt St: DRIVING right.
    *   The destination will be on the [RIGHT]. (Kong Fu Tea should be on right side)

*   **Kong Fu Tea to Goodwill:**
    *   Head southwest on Hoyt St toward Schermerhorn St: DRIVING opposite direction
    *   Turn [LEFT] onto Schermerhorn St: Turn left.
    *   Turn [RIGHT] at the 1st cross street onto Bond St: Next right turn on the cross street .
   *  The destination will be on the [LEFT]. (GoodWill should be on right side)

Therefore, the correct answer is:

[[[A]]]

Here's the completed prompt:

Head north on Fleet Pl toward Myrtle Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 49 ft.
Turn [RIGHT] onto Myrtle Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Myrtle Ave turns left and becomes Abolitionist Pl/Duffield St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [LEFT] onto Willoughby St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 259 ft.
Turn [LEFT] at the 1st cross street onto Bridge St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [RIGHT] onto Hoyt St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 459 ft.
The destination will be on the [RIGHT].
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Hoyt St toward Schermerhorn St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 171 ft.
Turn [RIGHT] onto Schermerhorn St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.

Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head south on Fleet Pl toward Fair St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Take the crosswalk, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right toward Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Fulton St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Hoyt St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 

A. ['0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '118 ft', '49 ft', '486 ft', '459 ft', '79 ft', '0.1 mi']      B. ['6.3 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '442.8 ft', '219.9 ft', '0.1 mi', '641.2 ft']
C. ['132.2 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '916.6 ft', '419.6 ft', '0.1 mi', '460.7 ft']      D. ['388.2 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '277.3 ft', '471.0 ft', '0.1 mi', '897.4 ft']
After analysing the images, I will provide the solution.

The traversal would be as follows:

1. **Brooklyn Cancer Center to Kung Fu Tea:** Head south on Fleet Pl toward Fair St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 

2. **Crossing Albee Square W/Gold St to continue traversal:** Take the crosswalk, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right toward Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].

3. **Turn and find Goodwill** Turn left onto Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Fulton St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Hoyt St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 

4. **Hoyt St to head to Goodwill:** Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 

This results in the following prompt:
Head south on Fleet Pl toward Fair St, then keep WALKING for approximately [0.1 mi]. 
Take the crosswalk, then keep WALKING for approximately [0.1 mi]. 
Turn right toward Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately [118 ft]. 
Turn left onto Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep WALKING for approximately [49 ft]. 
Turn right onto Fulton St, then keep WALKING for approximately [486 ft]. 
Turn left onto Hoyt St, then keep WALKING for approximately [459 ft]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [79 ft]. 
Turn right onto Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [0.1 mi]. 

Therefore, the answer is:
[[[A]]]

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: Brooklyn Cancer Center, Kong Fu Tea, GoodWill within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Goodwill NYNJ Store & Donation Center, 258 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      B. ['The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Goodwill NYNJ Store & Donation Center, 258 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
C. ['The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Goodwill NYNJ Store & Donation Center, 258 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      D. ['Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Goodwill NYNJ Store & Donation Center, 258 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
Based on the street imagery and considering one-way streets, the most time-efficient route is:

* **Start at Brooklyn Cancer Center (86 Fleet Pl):** This location is geographically the furthest north of the locations you provided.
* **Go to Goodwill NYNJ Store & Donation Center (258 Livingston St):** From Fleet Place, Livingston Street is a main throughfare to the southwest and to make a left turn onto this main street from Fleet Place is easier with less frequent traffic.
* **Go to Kung Fu Tea (40 Hoyt St):** Leaving Goodwill, Hoyt Street is a couple of streets away.

Therefore, the optimal route is B.
