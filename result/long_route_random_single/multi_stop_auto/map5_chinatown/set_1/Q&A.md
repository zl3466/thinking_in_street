Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket. Do not put anything else in triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head west on Canal St toward Manhattan Brg/Manhattan Bridge Lower RoadwayPass by Simpson Loans (on the left), then keep DRIVING for approximately 344 ft.
Turn [?] onto BoweryPass by Bank of America Financial Center (on the left), then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto Grand St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto Forsyth St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 463 ft.
Forsyth St turns left and becomes Hester St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 449 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head east on Hester St toward Allen St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 33 ft.
Turn [?] onto Allen St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Continue straight to stay on Allen St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 128 ft.
Turn [?] onto Division St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] onto Chatham Square, then keep DRIVING for approximately 407 ft.
Turn [?] after Citi (on the [?]), then keep DRIVING for approximately 295 ft.
Turn [?] onto Mulberry St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] onto Canal St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 456 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right']      B. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']
C. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left']      D. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left']
Here's the breakdown of the optimal route, along with the correct answer choice:

**Understanding the Constraints and Directions**

*   **One-Way Streets:** Chinatown is filled with one-way streets, so the route must respect these.
*   **Direction Changes:** Directions are based on the assumption that you are the driver looking out the windshield
*   **Ordered Destination:** As stated in the prompt, each destination should be approached in the order Popeyes -> ANJ -> Citibank
*   **The prompt begins facing Popeyes' chicken

**Analyzing the Route**

1.  **Popeyes to Bowery:**
    *   "Head west on Canal St toward Manhattan Brg/Manhattan Bridge Lower RoadwayPass by Simpson Loans (on the left), then keep DRIVING for approximately 344 ft"
    *   "Turn [???] onto BoweryPass by Bank of America Financial Center (on the left), then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi." You need to turn **right** onto Bowery to pass Bank of America on the left.
2.  **Bowery to Grand St:**
    *   You need to turn right at one of the second cross streets, **Grand St** fits since Hester St would loop back to where you begin driving on Canal St. After, driving on Grand.
3.  **Grand St to Hester St**:
    *  "Turn [?] onto Forsyth St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 463 ft." Because of traffic flow and one way roads, take a right to get to Forsyth.
4.  **Forsyth St to Allen St:
    *   "Forsyth St turns left and becomes Hester St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 449 ft."
    *   "The destination will be on the [?]" If you have been driving in the right direction, destination should be on your **right.**
5.  **Hester St to Allen St (heading to ANJ's Convenience):**
    *   To continue to the next destination, Head east on Hester St toward Allen St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 33 ft"
    *   "Turn [?] onto Allen St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi." Turn **left** onto Allen St.
6.  **Allen St Stay on Division St:
     * "Continue straight to stay on Allen St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 128 ft. Turn [?] onto Division St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi." Turning right onto Division St is an accurate direction to get to Chatham Sq

7.  **Division to to Citibank location:
    *   "Turn [?] onto Chatham Square, then keep DRIVING for approximately 407 ft" Turning right at Chatham will lead towards destination
    *   "Turn [?] after Citi (on the [?]), then keep DRIVING for approximately 295 ft". Since Citibank is on your right hand, taking a **left** after Citibank is a correct direction.
8.  **Mulberry to Canal (After Citibank):**
    *  "Turn [?] onto Mulberry St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi". Again, turning **right** will lead to Mulberry St
    *   "Turn [?] onto Canal St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 456 ft." Turn **right** to head towards direction and for traffic flows that allow that.

9. Finally, Citibank is on the **left** side.

**Putting It All Together**

The correct sequence of directions is: \['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left'] which corresponds to **[[[B]]]**.
