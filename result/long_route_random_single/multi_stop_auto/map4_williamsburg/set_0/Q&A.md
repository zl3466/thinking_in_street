The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: Brooklyn Bowl, Spectrum store on 7th St, a CVS store on 6th St within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket. Do not put anything else in triple square bracket.
A. ['Spectrum Store, 177 N 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211', 'CVS, 27 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249']      B. ['Spectrum Store, 177 N 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211', 'Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'CVS, 27 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249']
C. ['CVS, 27 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'Spectrum Store, 177 N 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211', 'Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249']      D. ['CVS, 27 N 6th St, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11249', 'Spectrum Store, 177 N 7th St, Brooklyn, NY 11211']
Based on the street layout and one-way street information discernible from the images, the most time-efficient order would be:

*   **Spectrum Store (177 N 7th St):** Located in the middle of the area of coverage.
*   **Brooklyn Bowl (61 Wythe Ave):** Taking note of the east bound one way street on the corner of N 7th and Wythe will make Brooklyn Bowl the most optimal next location.
*   **CVS (27 N 6th St):** Continuing south to 6th street

Thus the answer is:
