2. Turn right onto Fulton St and walk to Bond St. This distance is approximately 260.8 ft.
3. Head southeast on Fulton St toward Albee Square W/Gold St until Albee Square. This distance is approximately 96.8 ft.
4. Turn right onto Bond St (towards Fulton Mall). Pass by US Army Recruiting Office Downtown Brooklyn (on the right in 240 ft) and proceed to the intersection with Willoughby St. This distance is approximately 708.2 ft.
5. Finally, turn right onto Willoughby St toward the IHOP location. This distance is approximately 374.0 ft.
Therefore, the solution is A. ['827.4 ft', '260.8 ft', '96.8 ft', '708.2 ft', '374.0 ft']
