The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: Balenciaga, Dior store, UGG store within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket. Do not put anything else in triple square bracket.
A. ['DIOR New York Soho, 105 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012']      B. ['BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012', 'DIOR New York Soho, 105 Greene St, New York, NY 10012']
C. ['DIOR New York Soho, 105 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012', 'BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012']      D. ['UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012', 'DIOR New York Soho, 105 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012']
Based on the street views and typical one-way street patterns in SoHo, the optimal route is:

1. Dior (105 Greene St)
2. Balenciaga (110 Greene St) - this requires driving north on Greene St as it is a one way street, and this is the only direction for Balenciaga store.
3. UGG (79 Mercer St)
