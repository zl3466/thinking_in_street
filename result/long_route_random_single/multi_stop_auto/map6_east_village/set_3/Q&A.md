The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
I want to traverse through the locations by driving: McDonald's on 1st Ave, Chase Bank on 2nd Ave, Citizens on 2nd Av in this exact order, with the starting position being facing McDonald's on 1st Ave. Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as a street being one-way drive.

Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head northeast on 1st Ave. toward E 7th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] onto E 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto 2nd Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 292 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on 2nd Ave toward E 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 203 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto E 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 36 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left']      B. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']
C. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left']      D. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left']
[[[A]]]
Here's the breakdown of the directions based on the images and the constraints:

*   **McDonald's on 1st Ave to Chase Bank on 2nd Ave**
    *   Head northeast on 1st Ave. toward E 7th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
    *   Turn **right** onto E 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
    *   Turn **right** at the 1st cross street onto 2nd Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 292 ft.
    *   The destination (Chase Bank) will be on the **left**.

*   **Chase Bank on 2nd Ave to Citizens on 2nd Ave**
    *   Head southwest on 2nd Ave toward E 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 203 ft.
    *   Turn **right** at the 1st cross street onto E 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 36 ft.
    *   The destination (Citizens Bank) will be on the **left**.

Therefore, the correct sequence is: ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left'].
