used frames [30, 40]

The images I uploaded contains 10 frames of images from a vehicle dash cam video. 
Determine the vehicle's movement direction (delta heading) and displacement (delta distance) between each frame. That is, for the 10 I uploaded, you should be able to generate 9 pairs of direction and displacement.
For delta heading, assume the vehicle's starting position in the first frame is heading 0 degree.You should then represent all later delta headings in degree values ranging between -180 and 180 degrees(clockwise) relative to the starting position at 0 degree.
Here, -180 and +180 degree would mean turning around and go in the complete opposite way compared to the previous frame.
For displacement, give your answer values in meter unit.
Finally, present your response in json format:
```json {"delta_heading": [degree1, degree2, ... degree9],
"displacement": [displacement1, displacement2, ... displacement9]
}```
Make sure you have 9 int or float elements in both the direction list and displacement list.
The delta headings and displacements can't be all the same

Here's a JSON formatted response estimating the vehicle's delta heading and displacement between frames based on the provided images. Please note that these are estimations, as precise calculations would require actual camera data and calibration.

**Explanation of estimations:**

*   **Delta Heading:**  The images show the vehicle primarily moving straight ahead with minimal changes in direction. The very small change in angle might be due to the car switching lanes or minor steering adjustments.
*   **Displacement:** Based on visible landmarks (lane markings, building sizes), I've estimated the displacement between each frame to be approximately 8 meters. This assumes a relatively constant speed of the vehicle within an urban setting.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Accuracy:** These values are rough estimates. A precise assessment would require:
    *   Camera intrinsic parameters (focal length, sensor size).
    *   Vehicle speed and frame rate of the dashcam video.
    *   Object recognition and tracking algorithms to measure precise displacement.
*   **Scale:**  The accuracy of the displacement depends significantly on how well the scales of the road, building, and cars are perceived.
*   **Perspective Distortion:** The dashcam's wide-angle lens introduces perspective distortion, especially at the edges of the image, which can affect heading estimation.
