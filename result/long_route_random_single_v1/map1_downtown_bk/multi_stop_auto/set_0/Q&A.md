Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head southeast on Fulton St toward Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 52 ft.
Turn [?] onto Albee Square W/Gold St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto Willoughby St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto Bridge St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto Hoyt St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 459 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Hoyt St toward Schermerhorn St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 171 ft.
Turn [?] onto Schermerhorn St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Bond St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 249 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Livingston St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 89 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right']      B. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right']
C. ['left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right']      D. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left']
Based on the street views, here's the analysis of the optimal route:

*   **Starting at AT&T (Fulton St facing southeast):**
    *   Turn **left** onto Albee Square W/Gold St
    *   Turn **left** onto Willoughby St
    *   Turn **left** at the 2nd cross street onto Bridge St
    *   Turn **right** onto Hoyt St
        *The destination will be on the right (Kung Fu Tea).
*   **From Kung Fu Tea to IHOP:**

    *  Head southwest on Hoyt St toward Schermerhorn St
    * Turn **right** onto Schermerhorn St
    * Turn **left** at the 1st cross street onto Bond St
    * Turn **right** at the 1st cross street onto Livingston St
    * The destination will be on the left (IHOP)

So the final answer is:

[[[C]]]

Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head northwest on Fulton St toward Elm Pl, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Hoyt St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right onto Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 

A. ['716.6 ft', '0.2 mi', '0.3 mi', '0.2 mi']      B. ['599.6 ft', '0.3 mi', '0.1 mi', '0.2 mi']
C. ['433 ft', '459 ft', '79 ft', '0.1 mi']      D. ['499.8 ft', '0.0 mi', '0.2 mi', '0.0 mi']
Here's the breakdown to determine the correct answer:

1. **Starting Point:** Facing the AT&T Store.
2. **First Destination: Kong Fu Tea:** This location is east and across the street from AT&T.

3. **Second Destination: IHOP:** This location is located northwest corner from the first two destination.

4.  **Route Analysis and Distance Estimates (Based on street views, which can be imperfect)**
*   Fulton St from the location of AT&T to Hoyt St is estimated to be around 500ft.

*   The walk distance of Hoyt St would be a street corner turn that is almost next door, less than 0.1mile.

*   From Hoyt St to Livingston St going northeast is a short walk, which is less than 0.2 mi.

*   From Livingston St to to IHOP is a very short walk less than 0.05 mile.

5.  **Final Answer and Formatting:**
The most reasonable choice is: [[[D]]]
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Hoyt St toward Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [0.2 mi]. Turn right onto Livingston St, then keep WALKING for approximately [0.0 mi].

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: AT&T, Kong Fu Tea, IHOP within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      B. ['AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
C. ['IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      D. ['Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
Based on the street view images and considering the likely road network and one-way street directions, the most time-efficient order of visiting the locations would be:

**[[[A]]]**

Here's why:
* **Kung Fu Tea to IHOP:** The images show that Kung Fu Tea and IHOP are in close proximity, the one-way traffic flows allow to reach IHOP after a minor detour from Kung Fu Tea.
* **IHOP to AT&T:** Livingston St will give direct access to Fulton St where the store is located.

Therefore, the list starts with: Kung Fu Tea, 40 Hoyt St, Brooklyn, NY 11201.
It will then proceed to IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201.
Finally it will proceed to AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201.
