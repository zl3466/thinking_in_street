The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: IHOP, AT&T, Brooklyn Cancer Center within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      B. ['The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
C. ['The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201']      D. ['AT&T Store, 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'IHOP, 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201', 'The Brooklyn Cancer Center, 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201']
After reviewing the images and considering the street layouts and one-way streets, the optimal order to visit the locations appears to be:

*   **AT&T Store:** 476-478 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201
*   **IHOP:** 253 Livingston St, Brooklyn, NY 11201
*   **The Brooklyn Cancer Center:** 86 Fleet Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11201
