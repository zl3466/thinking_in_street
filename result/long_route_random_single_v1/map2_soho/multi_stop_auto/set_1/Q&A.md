The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
I want to traverse through the locations by driving: MoMA Design Store, UGG store, Balenciaga in this exact order, with the starting position being facing MoMA Design Store. Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as a street being one-way drive.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head northeast on Crosby St toward Prince St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Prince St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Mercer St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Mercer St toward Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Greene St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [?]. 

A. ['0.1 mi', '375.2 ft', '0.3 mi', '0.3 mi', '188.1 ft', '190.7 ft']      B. ['0.3 mi', '81.1 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.0 mi', '446.3 ft', '129.9 ft']
C. ['492 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.2 mi', '259 ft', '253 ft', '0.2 mi']      D. ['0.2 mi', '372.1 ft', '0.2 mi', '0.3 mi', '685.0 ft', '625.0 ft']
[[[A]]]
Here's the breakdown of why A is the best choice and how the distances fit the prompt:

* **MoMA Design Store to UGG:**
    * "Head northeast on Crosby St toward Prince St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi." -  This is correct. Driving northeast on Crosby Street leads to the intersection with Prince Street, about 0.1 miles away.
    * "Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Prince St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 375.2 ft." - This is correct. Turning left onto Prince Street and driving for 375.2 ft. takes you to the intersection with Mercer St.
    * "Turn left onto Mercer St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi." - This is correct. Turning left onto Mercer St and driving for approximately 0.3 miles brings you to a part of Greene st with the UGG store.

* **UGG to Balenciaga:**
    * "To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Mercer St toward Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi." - This takes you to the Balenciaga store. This is correct since UGG and Balenciaga are close together
    * "Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 188.1 ft." - This is correct as this takes you back to Greene street
    * "Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Greene St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 190.7 ft." - This is correct as it brings you the Balenciaga store.

The other options have distance values that are inconsistent with the actual relative positions of these stores on Google Maps.

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: MoMA Design Store, UGG store, Balenciaga within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['MoMA Design Store, 81 Spring St A, New York, NY 10012', 'UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012', 'BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012']      B. ['MoMA Design Store, 81 Spring St A, New York, NY 10012', 'UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012', 'BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012']
C. ['BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'MoMA Design Store, 81 Spring St A, New York, NY 10012', 'UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012']      D. ['UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012', 'BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'MoMA Design Store, 81 Spring St A, New York, NY 10012']
Based on the spatial information and one-way street constraints observed in the images, the most time-efficient order is:

MoMA Design Store, 81 Spring St A, New York, NY 10012 -> UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012 -> BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012.

Therefore, the answer is [[[A]]]
