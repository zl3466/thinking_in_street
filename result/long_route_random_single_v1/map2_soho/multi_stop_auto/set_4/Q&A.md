Based on the images and the constraints you've provided, here's the breakdown and the answer:

*   **UGG Store:** The starting point is assumed to be in front of the UGG store, looking in a South Westerly direction.
*   **Spatial reasoning:** Given that it is assumed you start near the UGG store, you need to turn right onto Broome street. Continue on Broome st, and turn right to Greene street. Continue on Greene street and turn right onto spring street. After spring street, you would have to turn right onto Broadway for the Converse store.
*   **Bloomingdale's:** Next, you will head Southwest on Broadway to turn left onto Grand Street. Continue on Grand Street, turning left onto Crosby Street and then Left on Prince Street to get to the Bloomingdale's outlet.
*   **Converse Store:** From the Bloomingdale's, turn left on Broadway to get to the Converse store.

Based on this route and the images provided, the distances that would be approximately followed for the trip:
Head southwest on Mercer St toward Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.1 mi].
Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [324.5 ft].
Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Greene St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.3 mi].
Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Spring St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [199.0 ft].
Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto Broadway, then keep DRIVING for approximately [68.9 ft].
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Broadway toward Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.2 mi].
Turn left onto Grand St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.3 mi].
Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Crosby St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [189.9 ft].
Turn left at the 3rd cross street onto Prince St, then keep DRIVING for approximately [0.1 mi].

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: UGG store, Bloomingdale's, Converse store within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ["Bloomingdale's, 504 Broadway, New York, NY 10012", 'UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012', 'Converse Flagship Store, 560 Broadway, New York, NY 10012']      B.

Based on the street views and considering one-way street constraints, the optimal order for driving to these locations would be:

1. **Converse Flagship Store, 560 Broadway, New York, NY 10012**
2. **Bloomingdale's, 504 Broadway, New York, NY 10012**
3. **UGG Soho, 79 Mercer St, New York, NY 10012**
