Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head northeast on Greene St toward Prince St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto W Houston St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto Broadway, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Broadway toward Spring St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto Broome St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto Greene St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right']      B. ['right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right']
C. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']      D. ['left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right']
Based on the street-level imagery provided, the correct traversal route aligning with the specified stores (Dior, Converse, Balenciaga) and considering one-way street directions in this area of SoHo, New York is described by option [[[D]]].

Here's the explanation:

* **Starting at Dior, heading to Converse:** You start facing north on Greene St. This aligns with the prompt's "Head northeast on Greene St toward Prince St" (Greene Street runs one-way). The address for the DIOR store is 109 Greene Street, which aligns the user to be at the start location.
* **From Greene to Houston and then to Broadway:** To reach the Converse store (560 Broadway), you would turn **left** onto W Houston, then turn **right** onto Broadway. This takes you north on Broadway. This sets up the proper direction to approach Converse.
* **To reach Balenciaga from Converse:** To reach Balenciaga, you would turn **left** onto Broome, then turn **right** onto Greene.
* **The end result :** The Balenciaga store will be on the **right**.

Therefore, the sequence "left, right, left, right, right, right" corresponds to the correct navigation.

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: Dior store, Converse store, Balenciaga within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['DIOR New York Soho, 105 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'Converse Flagship Store, 560 Broadway, New York, NY 10012', 'BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012']      B. ['DIOR New York Soho, 105 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'Converse Flagship Store, 560 Broadway, New York, NY 10012']
C. ['BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'Converse Flagship Store, 560 Broadway, New York, NY 10012', 'DIOR New York Soho, 105 Greene St, New York, NY 10012']      D. ['Converse Flagship Store, 560 Broadway, New York, NY 10012', 'DIOR New York Soho, 105 Greene St, New York, NY 10012', 'BALENCIAGA, 110 Greene St, New York, NY 10012']
Based on the provided street views and considering the one-way street constraints:

*   Converse is on Broadway.

*   Balenciaga is at 110 Greene Street.

*   Dior is at 105 Greene Street.

Greene Street is one-way southbound. This means one cannot drive from Dior (105 Greene) to Balenciaga (110 Greene). Therefore, Balenciaga must be visited before Dior. Broadway runs north. Based on the images and the location, going to Converse first, then Greene St south is the best solution.

Given the above observations, the optimal order is likely:

1.  Converse (Broadway)
2.  Balenciaga (110 Greene - driving south on Greene)
3.  Dior (105 Greene - continuing south on Greene)

So, the answer is: [[[D]]]
