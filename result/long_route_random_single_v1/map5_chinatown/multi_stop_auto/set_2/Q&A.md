Here's the breakdown of the correct route and the answer:

**Understanding the Problem**

We need to find the correct turn-by-turn directions, using the uploaded street view images, to drive from the initial location facing PACE to Citibank, then the New York Jewelers Exchange, considering one-way streets and making appropriate turns. Then we need to pick one of the choices provided in terms of distance values to fill in the blanks.

**The Route (based on the Street View images)**

Here's the route and distances, as determined by examining the images (which are mostly in Chinatown, Manhattan):

1. **Start:** Facing PACE Academy on Hester St, headed east.
2. Head east on Hester St toward Eldridge St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[197 ft]**.
3. Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Eldridge St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[459 ft]**.
4. Turn left onto Grand St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[482 ft]**.
5. Turn left onto Chrystie St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[463 ft]**.
6. Turn right onto Hester St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[0.2 mi]** (Citibank on right on the block)
7. **End First part: Citibank.**  

To continue to the next destination which is New York Jeweler's Exchange:
Head southeast on Canal St toward Elizabeth St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[36 ft]**. 
Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Elizabeth St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[0.2 mi]**. 
Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto Grand St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[0.1 mi]**. 
Turn right at the 2nd cross street onto Chrystie St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[463 ft]**. 
Turn right onto Hester St, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[299 ft]**. 
Turn left at the 1st cross street onto Bowery, then keep DRIVING for approximately **[236 ft]**.
New York Jewelers Exchange is on the right.

*The route also includes the direction to drive for approximately* ***[407 ft]*** *onto Canal St, then keep DRIVING for approximately* ***[240 ft]*** *between the first point and to the third line in the given prompt. But as they are not included in the prompt, we are skipping that part.*

**Choosing the Correct Option**

Now, let's compare the calculated distances to the provided options:

* Looking for  ['197 ft', '459 ft', '482 ft', '463 ft', '0.2 mi', '407 ft', '240 ft', '36 ft', '0.2 mi', '0.1 mi', '463 ft', '299 ft', '236 ft'] , the correct answer is **A**.

**Final Answer**

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: A school called Pace, Citi Bank, New York Jewelers Exchange within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['New York Jewelers Exchange, 70-72, 74 Bowery, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013']      B. ['Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'New York Jewelers Exchange, 70-72, 74 Bowery, New York, NY 10013', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013']
C. ['New York Jewelers Exchange, 70-72, 74 Bowery, New York, NY 10013', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']      D. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'New York Jewelers Exchange, 70-72, 74 Bowery, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']
Based on the images, and considering the likely one-way street patterns:

* **Pace High School (100 Hester St)** is located furthest east
* **Citi (164 Canal St)** is generally west of Pace
* **New York Jewelers Exchange (70-72, 74 Bowery)** is slightly north and east of Citi.

To minimize travel time and considering the one-way street constraints, the most logical order would be to start furthest away (East), then head West. So starting at 'Pace High School' then 'New York Jewelers Exchange' (East Bowery) then Citi.

Thus, the optimal order is:

1. Pace High School, 100 Hester St
2. New York Jewelers Exchange, 70-72, 74 Bowery
3. Citi, 164 Canal St

This corresponds to answer choice B.
