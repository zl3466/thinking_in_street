    *   To reach Elizabeth from Hester, we must turn <<<left>>>.

*   "Turn [?] onto Canal St, then keep WALKING for approximately 36 ft."
    *   To reach Canal St from Elizabeth St, we must turn <<<right>>>.
    *   "The destination will be on the [?]." - ANJ Convenience to Citi Bank, you would be on the <<<left>>> on Canal St

**From Citi Bank (Canal St):**

*   "Head southeast on Canal St toward Elizabeth St, then keep WALKING for approximately 335 ft."
    *   Begin at a CitibBank
*   "Turn [?] onto Bowery, then keep WALKING for approximately 66 ft."
    *   To reach Bowery from Canal St, we must turn <<<right>>>.
*   "Turn [?] onto Manhattan Brg/Manhattan Bridge Lower Roadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 138 ft."

Here's the breakdown to determine the correct route and the answer:

**1. Understanding the Traversal Goal:**

* Start facing ANJ Convenience.
* Navigate to Citi Bank.
* Next is Popeyes Fried Chicken.

**2. Analyzing the Street Directions and Road Layout:**

Looking through the images, we can observe the following relevant points:

*   **ANJ Convenience:** Located at the intersection of Hester St and Allen St.
*   **Hester St:** Appears to be two-way street.
*   **Citi Bank:** Located at the intersection of Division St and Chatham Square.
*   **Popeyes Fried Chicken:** Located at the intersection of Canal and Forsyth Street, Eastbound of the city.
*   **Allen Street:** Runs one-way towards the South direction.
*   **Division Street:** Runs East to West direction.
*   **Mulberry Street:** Runs North to South direction, and intersects both Canal Street and Hester Street,
*   **Elizabeth Street:** Runs North to South direction, and intersects both Canal Street and Hester Street.

**3. Breaking Down the Route and Filling the Blanks:**
*   "Head east on Hester St toward Allen St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 33 ft." 
    *   This sets our starting point and initial direction.

*   "Turn [[[_**right**_]]] onto Allen St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi." 
    *   To head South to Division St, and considering Allen Street is one-way, you would turn [right].

*   "Continue straight to stay on Allen St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 128 ft."

*   "Turn [[[_**left**_]]] onto Division St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi."
    *   To reach the area near Chatham Square / Citi, you would turn [left] into Division Street.

*   "Turn [[[right]]] onto Chatham Square, then keep DRIVING for approximately 407 ft."

*   "Turn [[[right]]] after Citi (on the [[[left]]]), then keep DRIVING for approximately 295 ft."
    *   After identifying the location of Citi Bank, and which side to turn into Chatham Square, we can determine that we turn [right] into Forsyth St.

*   "Turn [[[_**right**_]]] onto Mulberry St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi."

*   "Turn [[[left]]] onto Canal St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 456 ft."

*   "The destination will be on the [[[right]]] "
The result of the previous turn brings you on the correct direction, and the Popeyes would be on your right as you drive along.

**To continue to the next destination:** Head southeast on Canal St toward Elizabeth St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 36 ft.
Turn [[[left]]] at the 1st cross street onto Elizabeth St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [[[left]]] at the 2nd cross street onto Grand St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [[[right]]] at the 2nd cross street onto Chrystie St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [[[right]]] onto Canal St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 30 ft.
The destination will be on the [[[right]]].

**4. Conclusion:**

The route based on spatial information extracted from the dash cam footage, and directional considerations leads us to Answer [B].

**Final Answer: [[[B]]]**

Here's the breakdown to determine the correct traversal and the answer:

**Understanding the Goal**

The goal is to find the correct sequence of actions to walk from facing ANJ Convenience to Citi Bank, and then to Popeyes Fried Chicken.

**Determining the Route**

1.  **ANJ Convenience to Citi Bank:** ANJ Convenience is located on the corner of Hester and Eldridge. To go to Citi Bank, which is on the corner of Canal and Elizabeth, first go west on Hester Street. Then turn left (south) on Elizabeth Street to go to the intersection of Elizabeth Street and Canal Street.

2.  **Citi Bank to Popeyes:** Citi Bank is at the corner of Canal and Elizabeth, head to the intersection of Canal and Bowery. Popeyes is located at the intersection of Canal St and Bowery so walk southeast on Canal Street. Turn left onto Bowery to go on to Manhattan Bridge. Turn right on Manhattan Bridge Lower Roadway, turn left to Canal street, then turn right on Canal Street then turn left to stay on Canal Street.

**Mapping Route Actions to Distances (using Google Maps as a reference)**

Let's break down the walking directions to estimate the distances:

*   **Head west on Hester St toward Eldridge St:** Approximately 0.2 mi
*   **Turn left onto Elizabeth St:** Approximately 446 ft to Elizabeth st

*   **Turn right onto Canal St:** Approximately 36 ft to Canal St
*   **Head southeast on Canal St toward Elizabeth St:** Approximately 335 ft
*   **Turn left onto Bowery:** Approximately 66 ft
*   **Turn right onto Manhattan Brg/Manhattan Bridge Lower Roadway:** Approximately 138 ft
*   **Turn left toward Canal St:** Approximately 39 ft
*   **Turn right onto Canal St:** Approximately 43 ft
*   **Turn left to stay on Canal St:** Approximately 95 ft

Based on the estimated distances, the correct option is:

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: ANJ Convenience, Citi Bank, Popeyes Fried Chicken within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, 125 Canal St, New York, NY 10002', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'ANJ Convenience, 84 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']      B. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'ANJ Convenience, 84 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, 125 Canal St, New York, NY 10002']
C. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, 125 Canal St, New York, NY 10002', 'ANJ Convenience, 84 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']      D. ['ANJ Convenience, 84 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, 125 Canal St, New York, NY 10002']
Based on the street views and considering one-way streets and general traffic flow in that area, here's a reasoned deduction for the optimal route:

* **Canal Street:** Canal Street is a major thoroughfare that runs east-west. Citi Bank (164 Canal St) and Popeyes (125 Canal St) are located on it.
* **Hester Street:** Hester Street generally runs parallel to Canal Street. ANJ Convenience (84 Hester St) is located on it.

Given these constraints, a time-efficient route would likely be:
1. Start on Canal Street, visiting Citi Bank (164 Canal St).
2. Continue on Canal Street to Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (125 Canal St).
3. Proceed to Hester Street and visit ANJ Convenience (84 Hester St).

This route avoids unnecessary turns against one-way traffic. The reverse order (ANJ -> Popeyes -> Citi) or starting with ANJ would require navigating several shorter blocks and potentially getting stuck behind traffic turning from other streets.

Therefore, the optimal order is: Citi, Popeyes, ANJ.
