Citi Bank (164 Canal St) and Popeyes (125 Canal St) are located on it.\n* **Hester Street:** Hester Street generally runs parallel to Canal Street. ANJ Convenience (84 Hester St) is located on it.\n\nGiven these constraints, a time-efficient route would likely be:\n1. Start on Canal Street, visiting Citi Bank (164 Canal St).\n2. Continue on Canal Street to Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (125 Canal St).\n3. Proceed to Hester Street and visit ANJ Convenience (84 Hester St).\n\nThis route avoids unnecessary turns against one-way traffic.
