Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head east on Hester St toward Eldridge St, then keep WALKING for approximately 390 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head west on Hester St toward Eldridge St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] onto Elizabeth St, then keep WALKING for approximately 446 ft.
Turn [?] onto Canal St, then keep WALKING for approximately 36 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right']      B. ['right', 'left', 'right', 'right']
C. ['right', 'left', 'right', 'right']      D. ['right', 'left', 'left', 'left']
Here's the breakdown of the traversal and why the answer is B:

*   **Start: Facing Pace School Head east on Hester St toward Eldridge St, then keep WALKING for approximately 390 ft.**

*   **Destination: ANJ Convenience**
The destination will be on the [[B] right]. (As can be seen in the images from the start, Anj Convenience is always located at the walker's right)

*   **Continue to the next destination: Head west on Hester St toward Eldridge St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi.**
    * Turn right onto Elizabeth St, then keep WALKING for approximately 446 ft.
    * Turn left onto Canal St, then keep WALKING for approximately 36 ft.

*   **Destination: Citi Bank** The destination will be on the right. (Since you are walking north on Elizabeth, after you turn onto Canal, the Citi Bank is on the right)

Therefore, the correct answer is [[[B]]] as the prompt describes a plausible traversal route to the locations.

Based on the street imagery and the provided locations, here's the answer:

[[[A]]]
Head east on Hester St toward Eldridge St, then keep WALKING for approximately 390 ft. 
To continue to the next destination, Head west on Hester St toward Eldridge St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi. 
Turn left onto Elizabeth St, then keep WALKING for approximately 446 ft. 
Turn right onto Canal St, then keep WALKING for approximately 36 ft. 

**Explanation**

1. **Start facing Pace:** The starting point must be 48 Hester St.

2. **To ANJ Convenience:**
    *   From Hester St head east (which is confirmed through Street View), it requires you to traverse approximately 390 ft (A) or approximately 16.9 ft (B) with (A) being the right choice as (B) puts you past the location.

3. **To Citi Bank:**
    *   From 89 Canal St head west on Canal St, this requires you to traverse approximately 0.2 mi.
    *Turn Left onto Elizabeth st requires a walk of approximately 446 ft.

4. **Continue to Cit Bank:**
   * From that same spot go to and slightly past Bayard (36ft), Cit is located on the corner.

Here's the breakdown to determine the correct answer:

* **Starting Point and Direction:** The instructions start facing a school called Pace which means traveling EAST.
* **Waypoint 1: ANJ Convenience:** ANJ Convenience is located on the left side of the street. From Pace, the first direction is correct: "Head east on Hester St toward Eldridge St."
* **Waypoint 2: Citi Bank :** There is a Citi Bank on the right of the destination, and so from the previous location, "Head east on Hester St toward Allen St". To arrive at Cit Bank, you have to:
*   Turn right onto Allen St, and then continue straight to stay on Allen St.
*   Turn right onto Division St, to arrive at the destination.
* **Waypoint 3: To get back on Canal street :**
* After Citi (on the right), turn right and get on Mulberry St.
* To get to desired location, "Turn right onto Canal St."

Based on this, the distances are best represented by option D

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: A school called Pace, ANJ Convenience, Citi Bank within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'ANJ Convenience, 84 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']      B. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'ANJ Convenience, 84 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']
C. ['Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'ANJ Convenience, 84 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']      D. ['ANJ Convenience, 84 Hester St, New York, NY 10002', 'Citi, 164 Canal St, New York, NY 10013', 'Pace High School, 100 Hester St, New York, NY 10002']
Here's how we can determine the most time-efficient route based on the provided images and constraints:

**Understanding the Constraints**

*   **One-Way Streets:** We need to identify one-way streets and their direction to ensure a feasible route.
*   **Traffic:** We cannot determine how the route is at certain time of the days in terms of traffic.
*   **Turning Restrictions**: We need to check the traffic sign around the location if a turn is possible.
*   **Road Configuration:** The order should minimize backtracking or circuitous routes.
**Analyzing the Street Images**

Based on examining the images and inferring street layouts (noting direction arrows, signs):
*   The starting point does not affect the route, so we assume from anywhere within this area.
*   Canal Street is a two-way street and we can easily visit the first location.
*   Hester Street is a one way street. Therefore, we have to access it from the west.
*   Pace is further out on Hester, so it is more time efficient to visit ANJ Convenience first and then drive East on Hester to Pace.

**Determining the Most Efficient Order**

Given the one-way streets, traffic signs, the most time efficient order would be:

1.  Citi Bank
2.  ANJ Convenience
3.  Pace High School

Thus the answer is:
