Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head northwest on E 9th St toward Stuyvesant St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto 3rd Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto E 6th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.6 mi.
Turn [?] onto Avenue B, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Avenue B toward E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 46 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn [?] onto 1st Ave., then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.4 mi.
Turn [?] onto E 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto 2nd Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 292 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left']      B. ['right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left']
C. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right']      D. ['right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right', 'left']
Here's the breakdown of the optimal route and why the chosen answer is correct:

*   **Starting Point:** At the intersection of E 9th St and 2nd Av, facing south towards Citizens

*   **Head northwest on E 9th St toward Stuyvesant St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.**

*   **Turn [[[D]]] right onto 3rd Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.**

*   **Turn right onto E 6th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.6 mi.**

*   **Turn left onto Avenue B, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.**

    *   Destination: Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union will be on the left.

*   **Head southwest on Avenue B toward E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 46 ft.**

*   **Turn left at the 1st cross street onto E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.**

*   **Turn left onto 1st Ave., then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.4 mi.**

*   **Turn right onto E 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.**

*   **Turn right at the 1st cross street onto 2nd Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 292 ft.**

    *   Destination: Chase Bank on 2nd Av will be on the left.

Here's why the other options are not a correct traversal route:
*Answer Option A* Is wrong since the 2nd Ave to 3rd Ave turn to the east has to be towards the right.
*Answer Option B* Is wrong since E 6th street only allows traffic to travel towards the west, with the 3rd Ave turn has to be towards the right to face that direction
*Answer Option C* Is wrong since the 2nd Ave to 3rd Ave turn to the east has to be towards the right.

Here's how I've approached this question:

1.  **Understand the Task:** I need to find the option that accurately describes a walking route from the bank near Cooper Union (Citizens Bank), to Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union, then to Chase Bank on 2nd Ave.
2.  **Visualize the Route:** I'll need to reference the images to understand the relative locations of the three locations. As stated in the original instructions, the locations need to be in that specific order.
3.  **Assess Each Option:** I'll use the images to mentally "walk" the described directions and check if the distances and turns lead me to the correct locations in the correct order.
    *   The key turns and relative distances are:
        *   Starting near Citizens Bank, you generally want to move in a south-easterly direction.
        *   Then you need to make your way to Avenue B (going a longer distance towards South East direction)
        *   Finally, you need to come back generally in a North-East direction on 2nd Avenue.

Based on this analysis, the option that best describes the traversal route is:

[[[A]]]

Here's the completed prompt:

Head southeast on E 9th St toward 2nd Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 524.0 ft.
Turn right, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Slight left, then keep WALKING for approximately 227.3 ft.
Turn right, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.4 mi.
Turn right toward Avenue B, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.4 mi.
Turn right onto Avenue B, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi.
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Avenue B toward E 4th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 173.4 ft.
Turn left, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Slight right, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn left, then keep WALKING for approximately 106.1 ft.
Slight right, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn left, then keep WALKING for approximately 502.7 ft.
Turn left toward E 9th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Slight right toward E 9th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn left onto E 9th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi.

A. ['0.8 mi', '0.3 mi', '167.0 ft', '0.5 mi', '0.9 mi', '0.9 mi', '0.7 mi', '0.8 mi', '0.9 mi']      B. ['0.1 mi', '0.1 mi', '0.6 mi', '0.1 mi', '46 ft', '0.3 mi', '0.4 mi', '0.1 mi', '292 ft']

Here's the breakdown of the traversal and the reasoning for the answer:

*   **Goal:** Drive from Citizens on 2nd Ave -> Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union -> Chase Bank on 2nd Ave.
*   **Constraints:** Obey one-way streets.

*   **Starting Position:** Facing north at the location, Citizens on 2nd Av

*   **Traversal Route:** The starting location is near E 9th st, turning right will lead you to Stuyvesant st. After you take 3rd Av, it forces you to continue on the street. Following the path correctly, it forces to the right on Avenue B. It forces you to turn right on E 3rd and turn right on 1st Avenue since Avenue B is a one-way. After the long right onto E 3rd it directs to turn right to 1st Ave, and turn Left on 11th St for correct destination.

Let's now fill in the blanks with the best approximations, using option B (The units should not affect the road being one-way, therefore, it only matters that the path to be followed correctly).
"Head northwest on E 9th St toward Stuyvesant St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi. 
Turn left onto 3rd Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn left onto E 6th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.6 mi.
Turn right onto Avenue B, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Avenue B toward E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 46 ft.
Turn right at the 1st cross street onto E 3rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn right onto 1st Ave., then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.4 mi.
Turn left onto E 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn left at the 1st cross street onto 2nd Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 292 ft."

Therefore, the correct answer is:

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: Citizens on 2nd Av, Lower East Side People's Federal Credit Union, Chase Bank on 2nd Ave within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['Citizens, 143 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003', 'Chase Bank, 156 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003', "Lower East Side People's FCU, 37 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009"]      B. ["Lower East Side People's FCU, 37 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009", 'Chase Bank, 156 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003', 'Citizens, 143 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003']
C. ['Chase Bank, 156 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003', 'Citizens, 143 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003', "Lower East Side People's FCU, 37 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009"]      D. ["Lower East Side People's FCU, 37 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009", 'Citizens, 143 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003', 'Chase Bank, 156 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003']
Based on the street level imagery provided, the time-efficient route would be: [[[D]]] "Lower East Side People's FCU, 37 Avenue B, New York, NY 10009", 'Citizens, 143 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003', 'Chase Bank, 156 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003'.
Rationale:
*Option D makes better sense since Avenue B is east of 2nd Avenue in this location, thus you would start at the bank on Avenue B, turn left when you reach 1st Av to head uptown towards 2nd Avenue where Chase and Citizens are located in the vicinity.
* Citizens (143 2nd ave) is one block South of Chase (156 2nd ave) so the last two points follow naturally.
