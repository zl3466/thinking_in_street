Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head southeast on N 6th St toward Kent Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 492 ft.
Turn [?] onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi.
Turn [?], then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head northwest toward Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.
Turn [?] onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 269 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'right']      B. ['right', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right']
C. ['left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left']      D. ['left', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right']
Based on the images provided, and assuming a starting position facing a CVS on N 6th St:

    Turn [[[left]]] onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.3 mi.
    Turn [[[left]]], then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.
    The destination (Brooklyn Bowl) will be on the [[[right]]].

*   To continue to the next destination, Head northwest toward Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.
   Turn [[[left]]] onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 269 ft.

*   The destination (Arlo Williamsburg) will be on the [[[right]]].

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with distance values in different units to make the prompt describe the correct traversal route:
Head southeast on N 6th St toward Kent Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn right, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head northwest toward Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
Turn left onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 

A. ['0.1 mi', '1.0 mi', '0.8 mi', '0.8 mi', '195.9 ft']      B. ['492 ft', '0.3 mi', '79 ft', '79 ft', '269 ft']
C. ['0.8 mi', '0.2 mi', '0.8 mi', '1.0 mi', '739.9 ft']      D. ['0.5 mi', '0.4 mi', '0.8 mi', '0.5 mi', '251.3 ft']
Here's the breakdown to figure out the route and the correct answer:

1.  **Starting point is facing a CVS store on 6th Street:**
    *   This means you're starting on North 6th Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

2.  **First destination: Brooklyn Bowl:**
    *   Brooklyn Bowl is near North 8th Street and Wythe Ave.
    *   The prompt starts:  "Head southeast on N 6th St toward Kent Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]." From looking at the images, heading southeast on N 6th Street toward Kent Ave appears accurate.
    *   Following this, to reach Brooklyn Bowl, the directions will have you turn left onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for a bit until arriving.
    *   Distance will be approximately ['492 ft', '0.3 mi']

3.  **Second Destination: Arlo Williamsburg/The Williamsburg Hotel:**
    *   Arlo Williamsburg/The Williamsburg Hotel is in the vicinity of North 9th and Wythe.
    *   "To continue to the next destination, Head northwest toward Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]". Head northwest is the correct direction to approach Arlo.
    *   Following this, the directions will have you turn left onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for a bit until arriving.
    *   Distance will be approximately ['79 ft', '269 ft']

4.  **Third Destination: CVS store on 6th St:**
    *   It appears that the provided directions describe a walking loop, in this case.
    *   After heading south on Wythe, the direction may need an additional step to turn onto N. 9th to the next part of the walk. Then the prompt would have you to keep WALKING for approximately [0.8 mi].

Based on the above, the answer is:
