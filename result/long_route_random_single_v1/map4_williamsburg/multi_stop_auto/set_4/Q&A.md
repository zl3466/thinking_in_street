Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head southwest on Bedford Ave toward N 10th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 39 ft.
Turn [?] onto N 10th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 85 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Wythe Ave toward N 11th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 269 ft.
Turn [?], then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left']      B. ['right', 'left', 'right', 'left', 'right']
C. ['left', 'right', 'left', 'left', 'right']      D. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left']
Here's the breakdown of the route and the corresponding answer:

*   **Starting Point: Facing Mugs Ale House**

    *   "Head southwest on Bedford Ave toward N 10th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 39 ft." (Initially facing Mugs Ale House)
    *   "Turn ***right*** onto N 10th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi." From the initial position, turning to North 10th street is to the right.
    *   "Turn ***right*** onto Wythe Ave, then keep WALKING for approximately 85 ft." Again, from this orientation, the turn onto Wythe Ave is to the right.
    *   "The destination will be on the ***left***." The destination Brooklyn Bowl is on the left.
    *To continue to the next destination, Head northeast on Wythe Ave toward N 11th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 269 ft.
    * Turn ***right***, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft. To turn to towards Williamsburg hotel is to the right.
    * The destination will be on the ***right***"

**Therefore, the correct answer is [[[D]]]**:
D. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left']

Here's the breakdown to determine the correct answer:

*   **Starting Point and First Destination:**
    *   You start facing Mugs Ale House.
    *   The first instruction says you are to head southwest on Bedford Avenue toward N 10th Street which is 39 feet away.

*   **Second Destination:**
    *   After you head southwest on Bedford Avenue toward N 10th Street, you are to turn right onto N 10th St which is 0.2 mi away.

*  **Brooklyn Bowl:**
    * After turning right on Wythe Avenue, it is 85 ft.
    *  Next, Head northeast on Wythe Ave toward N 11th St is 269 ft.
    * The total distance from when you need to turn right on N 10th St to the entrance to the Brooklyn Bowl is a couple hundred feet, but it requires turns so it is very hard to be accurately captured with this method.

*   **Last Instruction:**
    *   Turn right and walk 79 ft will get you to the end of your location.

Given this breakdown and the constraints, the most fitting answer is:

5.  Turn right at the 1st cross street onto N 10th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately
6.  Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Kent Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately
7.  Turn right onto N 13th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately
8.  Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Wythe Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately

Now, considering the possible value choices, the correct answer is:

[[[B]]]

**Explanation of Correct Distances (Answer B):**

*   **"Head northeast on Bedford Ave toward N 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 482 ft."** Starting at Mugs Ale House, travel up Bedford Avenue: 482 ft is approximately the distance between Mugs Ale House and the intersection of N 11th.
*   **"Turn left at the 2nd cross street onto N 12th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi."** Turning left at the 2nd cross street means you turned left to travel north on Bedford Ave, you would turn left after 2 blocks onto North 12th st for a distance of 0.2 miles or two blocks.
*    **"Turn left at the 2nd cross street onto Wythe Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 436 ft."** - Travel on North 12th St to Wythe Ave. the intersection to Brooklyn Bowl.
*   **"To continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Wythe Ave toward N 10th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 85 ft."** After you arrived at Brooklyn Bowl, The next destination requires to keep moving southwest direction until you reach North 10th street for 85 ft.
*   **"Turn right at the 1st cross street onto N 10th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 453 ft."** You would then need to turn right, to travel North to reach Kent St for 453 ft.
*   **"Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Kent Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi."** As you turn to Kent Ave, keep driving towards north on Kent Ave for 0.1 miles.
*   **"Turn right onto N 13th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 459 ft."** As you turn to North 13th street, keep driving for 459 ft to reach Wythe Ave on the left direction.
*   **"Turn right at the 1st cross street onto Wythe Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 413 ft."** Turn right into Wythe avenue and drive to the destination for about 413 ft.

**Why other options are wrong:**
* Each of the other options contain distances that are inconsistent with the actual path lengths and/or turn order.
