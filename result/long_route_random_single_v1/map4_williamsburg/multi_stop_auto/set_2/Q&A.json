The first cross street should be Kent Ave and turning RIGHT would be going toward Brooklyn Bowl (2nd St), as indicated in the prompt.\n    *   \"Turn [?] onto N 13th St\": Turning RIGHT from Kent Ave would be going to N 13th St.\n    *   \"Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto Wythe Ave\": There is no road between N 13th St and Brooklyn Bowl. However, since the prompt dictates a driving traversal, we can use a larger road called Wythe Ave. Turning LEFT from N 13th St at the first cross street, will take the car to Wythe Ave, where the destination will be on the LEFT.\n\n2.  **Brooklyn Bowl to Mugs Ale House:**\n\n    *   \"Head southwest on Wythe Ave toward N 11th St\": the car will traverse towards N 11th St to get closer to Mugs Ale House.\n    *   \"Turn [?] onto N 9th St\": Turning RIGHT will take the car to N 9th St.\n    *   \"Turn [?] at the 2nd cross street onto Bedford Ave\": Heading on to 2nd Street leads to a crossroads with Bedford Avenue on 1 way street. A LEFT turn at the 2nd cross street allows the vehicle to head to Mugs Ale House at N 8th St and Bedford Ave.\n    *   \"The destination will be on the [?]\": Mugs Ale House will be on the RIGHT side of the road.\n\n**The Answer**\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the correct answer is:\n\n[[[C]]]\n\n**Final Answer:** The filled prompt reads as follows:\n\nHead southeast on N 7th St toward Kent Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 144 ft.\nTurn [LEFT] at the 1st cross street onto Kent Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.3 mi.\nTurn [RIGHT] onto N 13th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 459 ft.\nTurn [RIGHT] at the 1st cross street onto Wythe Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 413 ft.\nThe destination will be on the [LEFT].\nTo continue to the next destination, Head southwest on Wythe Ave toward N 11th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.\nTurn [LEFT] onto N 9th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.\nTurn [RIGHT] at the 2nd cross street onto Bedford Ave, then keep DRIVING for approximately 299 ft.\nThe destination will be on the [RIGHT].\n----------\nTrue Correct Answer: B\n==========\n",
