Turn [?] onto Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 276 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head north on Broadway toward W 43rd St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto W 45th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 259 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['right', 'right', 'right', 'left']      B. ['right', 'right', 'left', 'right']
C. ['right', 'left', 'left', 'right']      D. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'left']
Based on the street view images and the layout of the specified locations, the correct traversal route with direction keywords would be:

Head northwest on W 42nd St toward 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the Americas, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn right onto Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 276 ft.
The destination will be on the right.
To continue to the next destination, Head north on Broadway toward W 43rd St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn left onto W 45th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 259 ft.
The destination will be on the right.

Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head northwest on W 42nd St toward 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the Americas, then keep DRIVING for approximately 364 ft.
Turn [?] onto 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the Americas, then keep DRIVING for approximately 282 ft.
Turn [?] at the 1st cross street onto W 43rd St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head northwest on W 43rd St toward Broadway, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.2 mi.
Turn [?] onto 8th AvePass by McDonald's (on the [?]), then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto W 46th St, then keep DRIVING for approximately 0.1 mi.
The destination will be on the [?].

A. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right']      B. ['right', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']
C. ['left', 'left', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left']      D. ['left', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'right']
Based on the spatial information gathered from the images provided, the answer that describes a correct traversal route is:

[[[A]]]

**Explanation:**

Here's why option A is the only plausible solution:

*   **Grace Building to 6th Avenue:** To start facing the Grace Building, you'll begin heading northwest on W 42nd St. Then, turning left onto 6th Avenue gets you closer to Times Square.
*   **6th Avenue to W 43rd:** In order to go towards Times Square, you will have to turn left at the 1st cross street onto W 43rd Street to move further into the city.
*   **Continue to Time Square:** This is a critical point. If you want to continue forward with the plan to go towards Times Square you can go straight up ahead passing by the side of New York time Square.
*   **8th Avenue and McDonalds:** The next instructions would then be right onto 8th Ave and you will be driving past a McDonalds on your right side.
*   **Marquis:** And then to arrive at the Marquis, you can then turn right onto W 46th st, then the destination Marquis Theatre would be on your right.

Because the only option that makes a valid path of travel is A, that is the correct answer.

A. ['0.2 mi', '276 ft', '0.1 mi', '259 ft']      B. ['263.3 ft', '285.3 ft', '0.2 mi', '0.1 mi']
C. ['292.2 ft', '248.6 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.1 mi']      D. ['246.2 ft', '269.5 ft', '0.2 mi', '0.1 mi']
Here's how we can approach this problem, combining spatial reasoning with the visual information from the images:

1.  **Identify Key Locations:**

    *   **Grace Building:** This is the starting point.
    *   **Times Square on 45th St:** This is the third location.
    *   **Marquis Theatre:** This location is between Grace Building and Times Square.

2.  **Establish Initial Direction:**
    *   The route starts heading NW on West 42nd Street, and then makes a right turn into Broadway, towards Times Square.

3.  **Reasoning for Distance Values:**

    *  From images 0 and 1, you head northwest on W 42nd St towards 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the Americas. You then make a right turn at Image 2 and continue along Broadway as indicated in Image 3. Finally you head up to Times Square as shown in Image 4. You continue onto Times Square, towards W 43rd St in images 5 - 14 and finally you turn left onto W 45th St at image 15 and continue to our desired spot at image 16. This means the route is 6th Ave => Broadway => W45th Street (Times Square).

    *   **W 42nd St toward 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the Americas to Broadway Turn:** From looking at the images, this is one short block from Grace Building to where the right turn will be made. This will be a short distance, less than 300ft. The best estimate is going to be 246.2ft.

    *   **Broadway to Times Square 43rd St Junction:** From the images, this is a medium distance of the length of approximately two to three buildings, thus 0.2miles is the best estimate.

    *   **W 45th St:** This is less than a block length, so around 0.1 miles.

Therefore, the answer is:

[[[D]]]
