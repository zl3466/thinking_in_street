If you want to continue forward with the plan to go towards Times Square you can go straight up ahead passing by the side of New York time Square.\n*   **8th Avenue and McDonalds:** The next instructions would then be right onto 8th Ave and you will be driving past a McDonalds on your right side.\n*   **Marquis:** And then to arrive at the Marquis, you can then turn right onto W 46th st, then the destination Marquis Theatre would be on your right.\n\nBecause the only option that makes a valid path of travel is A, that is the correct answer.\n----------\nTrue Correct Answer: B\n==========\n",

You then make a right turn at Image 2 and continue along Broadway as indicated in Image 3. Finally you head up to Times Square as shown in Image 4. You continue onto Times Square, towards W 43rd St in images 5 - 14 and finally you turn left onto W 45th St at image 15 and continue to our desired spot at image 16. This means the route is 6th Ave => Broadway => W45th Street (Times Square).\n\n    *   **W 42nd St toward 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the Americas to Broadway Turn:** From looking at the images, this is one short block from Grace Building to where the right turn will be made. This will be a short distance, less than 300ft. The best estimate is going to be 246.2ft.\n\n    *   **Broadway to Times Square 43rd St Junction:** From the images, this is a medium distance of the length of approximately two to three buildings, thus 0.2miles is the best estimate.\n\n    *   **W 45th St:** This is less than a block length, so around 0.1 miles.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n[[[D]]]\n\n----------\nTrue Correct Answer: A\n==========\n",
