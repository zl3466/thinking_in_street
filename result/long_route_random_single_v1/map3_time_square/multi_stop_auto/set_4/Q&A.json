The 259 ft value is a valid distance to arrive at Broadway from the initial direction, thus 259 ft makes sense for the \"259 ft\" value, we turn onto Broadway, 7th Ave, and continue along the way.\n\n4.  **Turn left onto W 42nd St:** The instruction to turn left from Broadway onto W 42nd street would be heading East, for an approximately \"0.2 mi\" distance. This checks out. The direction is aligned with the direction that this block on Broadway runs.\n\n5.  **Head northwest on W 42nd St toward 6th Ave/Bryant Pk/Ave of the Americas, then keep WALKING for approximately 364 ft.** The direction of walking Northwest makes sense to head towards Avenue of the Americas from having turned on W 42nd St East.
