[[[A]]]

Here's the breakdown of the directions:

*   Starting at M&M's World:  M&M's World is located in Times Square. Since we are starting in front of the building and facing it, it should be on our right for the initial direction.

The destination will be on the [[[left]]].To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on W 48th St toward 6th Ave/Ave of the Americas, then keep DRIVING for approximately 446 ft.

To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on W 48th St toward 6th Ave/Ave of the Americas, then keep DRIVING for approximately 446 ft.

*   Turn [[[left]]] onto 6th Ave/Ave of the Americas, then keep DRIVING for approximately 262 ft.

The images I uploaded are from a dash cam video footage from a vehicle. They cover most of the streets within an area. Using the spatial information you collect from the images I uploaded, answer the following multiple choice question:
Can you choose the optimal (time-efficient) order of visiting all these locations: M&M's World, a Chipotle on 48th St, the Time Square on 45th St within this area by driving? Since you are driving, you must consider constraints such as one-way drive streets.
Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
A. ['Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020', "M&M'S New York, 1600 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", 'Times Square, Manhattan, NY 10036']      B. ['Times Square, Manhattan, NY 10036', 'Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020', "M&M'S New York, 1600 Broadway, New York, NY 10019"]
C. ["M&M'S New York, 1600 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", 'Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020', 'Times Square, Manhattan, NY 10036']      D. ['Times Square, Manhattan, NY 10036', "M&M'S New York, 1600 Broadway, New York, NY 10019", 'Chipotle Mexican Grill, 129 W 48th St, New York, NY 10020']
Based on the street views and likely one-way street directions:

*   **M&M's World (1600 Broadway) and Times Square (45th St) are very close to each other along Broadway.**
*   Chipotle (129 W 48th St) is located off of 7th/8th Avenue and West 48th street. It's likely that the route to take to get to it would be to be already on Broadway to reach Chipotle, then continue that route to end up at Times Square and M&Ms.

Considering this, it is most time-efficient to visit Times Square on 45th Street, M&M'S New York, and then drive along Broadway to W 48th street to visit Chipotle. Thus the optimal order should be Times Square, M&Ms World, and then Chipotle

Therefore, the answer is [[[D]]]
