A small distance measured in feet is appropriate here.\n*   *To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].*: Then, you are instructed to again head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway. Since you just need to walk from Marquis Theatre towards Broadway to arrive at Time Square, a value measured in feet is appropriate here.\n*   *Turn left onto Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].*: Now turning onto Broadway, you must walk toward Times Square. Time Square takes up a block so a short value is needed to get through time square so a very small unit of mile i.e 0.0 mi is appropriate here.\n*   *Turn right onto W 48th St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].*: Continuing on Broadway, now it is necessary to turn right onto W 48th St which will be a short value in miles.\n*   *Walk for 79 ft, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].*: To get to the first location of the Time Square on 45th St requires you to walk a short distance measured in feet.\n\n**Comparing to the Multiple Choice Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, a sequence of distances like \"short feet, short feet, short mile, short mile, short feet\" is the correct pattern. Among the provided options, this pattern is the closest to option C \"131.3 ft, 0.1 mi, 0.0 mi, 0.1 mi, 121.2 ft\". Note that the prompt starts from \"head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway\", so we would need to reverse the order by aligning the destination to 46th St and W 49th Street to Broadway which is the south east direction in the images. And in general, the numerical values of this option are significantly lower than other options, making it more realistic to traverse this route by foot.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[[[C]]]\n\n**Explanation of Values (using Option C):**\n\n*   Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 131.3 ft.\n*   To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.\n*   Turn left onto Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.0 mi.\n*   Turn right onto W 48th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.\n*   Walk for 79 ft, then keep WALKING for approximately 121.2 ft.\n----------\nTrue Correct Answer: A\n==========\n",
