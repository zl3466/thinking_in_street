Put your single letter choice answer within a [[[letter]]] triple square bracket.
Choose from the four options below to fill in the blanks [?] in the following prompt with direction keywords 'left' or 'right' to make the prompt describe a correct traversal route:
Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 128 ft.
The destination will be on the [?].
To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 20 ft.
Turn [?] onto Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn [?] onto W 48th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 135 ft.
Walk for 79 ft, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.

A. ['left', 'right', 'left']      B. ['left', 'left', 'right']
C. ['right', 'left', 'right']      D. ['left', 'right', 'right']
Here's the breakdown to determine the correct walking route and the answer:

*   **Starting Point:** Facing the Marquis Theatre on W 46th Street.

*   **First Destination: Marquis Theatre** The directions state to Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 128 ft.
    Since you are starting directly facing the theatre, it will be on the right.

*   **Second Destination: Time Square on 45th St** The prompt states to Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 20 ft.
    Turn [?] onto Broadway. To get to time Square, which is heading south on Broadway, you will need to turn left onto Broadway.

*   **Third Destination: M&M's World** The prompt states to then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi. Turn [?] onto W 48th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 135 ft.
    From the previous destination (Time Square on 45th St), you need to turn right onto W 48th st, to get to M&M's World which is between 48th and 49th street.

*  The last statement to Walk for 79 ft, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft just guides you from one end of the building to the other as M&M's World takes up the whole block, it's just fluff.

Therefore, the full prompt correctly describing the path is:
Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 128 ft.
The destination will be on the **right**.
To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 20 ft.
Turn **left** onto Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
Turn **right** onto W 48th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 135 ft.
Walk for 79 ft, then keep WALKING for approximately 79 ft.

Therefore, the correct choice is [[[C]]]

Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?]. 
To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].

A. ['128 ft', '20 ft', '0.1 mi', '135 ft', '79 ft']      B. ['186.4 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.0 mi', '0.3 mi', '88.7 ft']
C. ['131.3 ft', '0.1 mi', '0.0 mi', '0.1 mi', '121.2 ft']      D. ['160.4 ft', '0.2 mi', '0.2 mi', '0.0 mi', '135.6 ft']
Here's the breakdown to determine the correct traversal route and answer the multiple-choice question:

**Understanding the Route**

1.  **Starting Point:** Facing the Marquis Theatre on W 46th St.
2.  **1st Destination: The Marquis Theatre:** This means you would need to traverse in order to face it, which implies either heading to the other side of the street (if there's a subway-exit on your side of the street) or heading across the street directly so you are in front of the theatre.
3.  **2nd Destination: Time Square on 45th St:** From the Marquis Theatre (on 46th St), you will head south along W 46th Street, then turn left on Broadway to arrive at Time Square between 45th and 46th St.
4.  **3rd Destination: M&M's World:** From Time Square, you will have to head north on W 48th St then find the M&M's World on the right side.

**Analyzing the Prompts**

*   *Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].*: This should be a short distance since you just need to walk towards the Marquis Theatre from your starting position. A small distance measured in feet is appropriate here.
*   *To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].*: Then, you are instructed to again head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway. Since you just need to walk from Marquis Theatre towards Broadway to arrive at Time Square, a value measured in feet is appropriate here.
*   *Turn left onto Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].*: Now turning onto Broadway, you must walk toward Times Square. Time Square takes up a block so a short value is needed to get through time square so a very small unit of mile i.e 0.0 mi is appropriate here.
*   *Turn right onto W 48th St, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].*: Continuing on Broadway, now it is necessary to turn right onto W 48th St which will be a short value in miles.
*   *Walk for 79 ft, then keep WALKING for approximately [?].*: To get to the first location of the Time Square on 45th St requires you to walk a short distance measured in feet.

**Comparing to the Multiple Choice Options**

Based on the analysis, a sequence of distances like "short feet, short feet, short mile, short mile, short feet" is the correct pattern. Among the provided options, this pattern is the closest to option C "131.3 ft, 0.1 mi, 0.0 mi, 0.1 mi, 121.2 ft". Note that the prompt starts from "head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway", so we would need to reverse the order by aligning the destination to 46th St and W 49th Street to Broadway which is the south east direction in the images. And in general, the numerical values of this option are significantly lower than other options, making it more realistic to traverse this route by foot.

Therefore, the final answer is:

[[[C]]]

**Explanation of Values (using Option C):**

*   Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 131.3 ft.
*   To continue to the next destination, Head southeast on W 46th St toward Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
*   Turn left onto Broadway, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.0 mi.
*   Turn right onto W 48th St, then keep WALKING for approximately 0.1 mi.
*   Walk for 79 ft, then keep WALKING for approximately 121.2 ft.
